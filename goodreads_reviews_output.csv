The Russian Debutante s Handbook,4,"March 20, 2008","It felt a little awkward and wrong somehow. Not Kafkaesque, where the protagonist invariably goes down amid the fatal combination of his own flaws and the malevolence of a hostile, unjust world; more...I don't know, a little more weaselly."
V ,5,"December 22, 2023","I haven't often been as excited to start a new book as I was to start V. Daddy's first Pynchon! I was eager and abuzz for a while--the man has been adjective-ized, for crying out loud. Consider the greats that have that honor. Dickensian. Kafkaesque. Vonnegut-y. What in the world does it mean to be Pynchonian? I couldn't wait to find out. And reading Pynchon's first novel felt like a good place to start."
V ,Not rated,"August 2, 2021","Crying of Lot 49 — the McGuffin is fundamentally unknowable, luring the searcher in a never-ending quest of madness and Kafkaesque impotence."
History,5,"May 11, 2021","One results in her rape. Another involves her being terrorised by public announcements and notices about the new racial laws targetting Jews (and, by definition, her). This casts her into a Kafkaesque world where she fears being arbitrarily victimised by Italian police and officials, and the German Gestapo and SS."
A Wild Sheep Chase,3,"February 19, 2023","This book sort of put me into a slump. Very Kafkaesque which was fun, but the first third of the book was very confusing."
A Wild Sheep Chase,5,"February 12, 2019","I really need to read more Murakami– I have only read two; Norwegian Wood (obviously) and this – which is incredible and in my view far superior. I must admit the premise of this before I read it didn’t really appeal but his writing is so wonderful I was into it from the first page – a lot is said about Murakami’s surrealism and Kafkaesque style (this books is book is part mystery and part magical realism with a postmodern twist) however he just writes about the mundane reality of everyday life so well, making that disproportionately fascinating almost cosy. Is this ever mentioned or is he mainly know for surreal twists?"
A Wild Sheep Chase,3,"June 23, 2019","Murakami also notes in that introduction that such strokes of luck out of the blue, in circumstances where he has really needed them right at that moment, happened to him through his life (the introduction is dated 2014 in the Secker hardback reprint of both of the first short Rat novels). So sudden strokes of luck in his novels are not mere literary devices. They did happen to him, if not those specific ones, and may well still do, as far as I know. Reading this review may be just another one of them, for all I know. Things have some random chance of becoming very significant in one's life, believe me. But a sheep? Why not a Zoltan arcade game, a black hole, or a wardrobe? Anyway, it's a sheep, and that's all there is to it. Well, perhaps a little more. Certainly enough to spawn an even weirder successor in Dance Dance Dance. That's where kitchen-table becomes magical realism; but, like the word processor, that term hasn't yet come into commonplace circulation; we would more readily have called the style Kafkaesque... Magical Realism, though, is a modernist experimental style with normality, or realism, involving the supernatural. But a supernatural sheep?"
A Wild Sheep Chase,3,"March 15, 2022","It feels a little too short for its scope - I think the Wind-Up-Bird Chronicle is the full realization of these ideas, as it works much better (He even mentions 'sitting at the bottom of a well'). It is just stuffed to the brim with really interesting ideas that just don't exactly feel like they come together. But maybe that's what works to its benefit? I hate using the word but 'Kafkaesque' works here, with the nameless and completely apathetic narrator blindly searching for a sheep through the mountains of Hokkaido off a black-and-white photograph."
A Wild Sheep Chase,4,"September 29, 2023","Cuộc săn cừu hoang rất đậm chất Kafkaesque khi nhân vật chính như lạc vào một mê cung bất tận của sự kiểm soát và thao túng. Là quyển thứ ba trong bộ The Rat của Murakami, mình nghĩ mn nên đọc Lắng nghe gió hát và Pinball trước để hiểu rõ bối cảnh, tính cách các nhân vật (như nhân vật Chuột, Jay vốn không được xây dựng nhiều trong truyện). Tình tiết truyện không quá hấp dẫn có lẽ là điểm trừ. Tuy nhiên, với lớp lang các mẩu truyện và lượng thông tin đan xen đồ sộ đã làm tác phẩm có chiều sâu và để lại nhiều cảm xúc với đọc giả."
A Wild Sheep Chase,4,"September 4, 2018","Murakami, here, is like Raymond Carver meets Kafka. Perhaps an unlikely pairing, but in all honesty it makes so much sense. The unnatural kafkaesque elements of the story seem to naturally come into play by means of the nonchalant nature of Murakami's prose. Likewise, the story line also weaves together the banal domestic conflicts that lie at the heart of so much of Carver's work, with the deep philosophical questions of suicide, war, and identity, as well as the ""magical realism"" of a something like unto Kafka."
A Wild Sheep Chase,4,"May 25, 2025","Filled with Kafkaesque situations, unnamed characters, and cigarette smoke, A Wild Sheep Chase is a hazy search for meaning in an ever-shifting world—a meaning not necessarily found by finding a mythical omnipotent sheep, but perhaps simply in chatting over a beer with an old friend in your old hometown."
A Wild Sheep Chase,Not rated,"May 31, 2022","It opens like a play, unfolds like a detective novel and ends on a kafkaesque note."
A Wild Sheep Chase,5,"October 17, 2012","No wonder why Murakami has received the Kafka prize, his writing is at times, 100% kafkaesque."
A Wild Sheep Chase,4,"April 9, 2016","To be honest I'm not really sure how to even begin reviewing this book. It's like trying to recall a dream you had, but you went ahead and brushed your teeth so all you have is a feeling that you experienced something... something different. Talk about a WTF book. The style is oh so very Kafkaesque at times, and at others not... The random elements make you laugh and the writing style makes you think. This is one of those books that I wouldn't re-read for pleasure, but it'll always remain etched in my mind."
hell screen,3,"June 2, 2024","Horse Legs: my favourite out of the bunch as it's actually quite funny. A Kafkaesque tale about a man called Oshino Hanzaburo, who is mistakenly killed by mysterious (Chinese) celestial(?) beings, who were trying to acquire Mr Henry Berrett. Upon learning of their mistake, send him back, but unfortunately because his legs have since decayed, they give him a pair of horse legs."
Zeno s Conscience,4,"January 30, 2016","But all of that is immaterial to the meat of this text which is, at its heart, a perennially Jewish and concomitantly quintessentially human endeavor showcasing the very worst and, at times, the very best of human success. This human success is nothing grand in the vein of a Joyce or a Thomas Mann but something much more easy to relate to and universal, that of the success of living day to day with one's growing memorial pile of failures and successes, losses and triumphs, loves, obsessions, and finally death. As stated earlier though, this is a dialectic. And since it is a dialectic the book's final passages (wherein SPOILER Zeno muses in a darkly ironic shade of social darwinism ) is really only best understood as part of an equation of various integers. When Zeno ruminated about the world shaking off humanity like a disease (akin to a Carlin observation) I was left desiccated and more than a little down (a credit to the pathos Svevo was and is able to evince) and this was made more piquant with the idea of mortality, an idea that this book places glib, funny, and ultimately Kafkaesque with. We all die if we're not dying. It's the rare few that actually live (and escape mention in this novel)."
Zeno s Conscience,4,"November 20, 2023","In other episodes, Zeno's story relates a terrible reflection of the inhumane arrogance of medical professionals in the vivid account of the death of his father, surely taken from first-hand experience, and the poor treatment by the society around him of his friend, a habitual gambler. Seeming a little bit Kafkaesque in places, this is a self-published masterpiece, and ahead of its time."
1q84,3,"October 2, 2021","I don't even know how to write a review about a book that makes this little sense to me. I guess I could sit down and try to understand exactly what the author was trying to convey in his Kafkaesque style but to be honest I have zero motivation to do so. It just felt like a lot of randomness ended with a happy ever after. I am no fan of Kafka but at least it was impossible to miss the deeper meaning. I felt like on the one hand the author liked to rely on random plot developments that the characters and readers just had to accept and take at face value but at the same time he didn't trust the reader to independently link earlier and later parts of the story or understand the metaphors which made the writing feel condescending and repetitive. Also what is with the page long quotations from other books? I also did not appreciate how the author anticipated the criticism his book would receive and included it in the plot at some stage. That just felt unsympathetic and a bit manipulative to me. I think Murakami and I are just not a match. It's imaginative - I guess - and includes some pretty nice character development. Although the main characters are the typical Murakami loners, after 1000 pages they somewhat grew on me. I liked the thriller like more action-like parts of the book and I managed to stuck with it somehow so three stars is fair but I think I will avoid this author from now on!"
1q84,5,"August 15, 2019","I can't say I understand everything that happens in this strange novel, but I loved the texture, the strangeness, the sense that its world was ordered but mysterious, profound, and not fully knowable. The story is surprisingly romantic and sweet despite layers of darkness and violence. I won't try to summarize the story and just say that if you like unpredictable adventures well told, give this Kafkaesque romance a try."
1q84,5,"December 13, 2017","P.S. Ushikawa was a great villain, but Murakami hated him, and I was able to feel how much Murakami didn't like this despicable little vermin of a man. That's why he brutally killed him. He was def. a Kafkaesque character."
1q84,5,"March 21, 2018","How about this Surreal/Kafkaesque, Urban-Portal-Fantasy/Epic Romance novel? Really the adjectives I used to describe this massive tome are redundant, not necessary and mere fluff. This novel can be classified as simply: Murakamian."
1q84,5,"August 16, 2020",Everything I would want out of a Kafkaesque dystopia *chefs kiss*
1q84,3,"October 6, 2012","First, let me say that this was my first Murakami novel. A number of people have said that 1Q84 is not the right book to start with, if you want to get into this author, and perhaps I should have listened. Murakami has a distinct style. His greatest strength perhaps is his ability to create a mood that is just a bit off, so that the entire time you’re reading this book you feel the world is not quite right—almost a Kafkaesque kind of feeling."
1q84,3,"May 2, 2025","The Kafkaesque writing is mundane and slow and at most times unnecessary. I think what makes Kafka great is, though his writing is mundane, the concepts behind it is always loaded and it seems no line is really wasted. Much of Murakami’s work feels like a waste. A lot of it feels like filler that neither drives the plot nor tells you anything meaningful about the character."
1q84,3,"February 21, 2012","Kafkaesque, with lots of delicious food eaten by the characters!"
The Complete Stories,5,"March 3, 2025","Franz Kafka is a whole vibe. You don’t get a term like “Kafkaesque” on your namesake gracing the blurb page of any eerily claustrophobic novel without being as fabulous as Franz and his legacy lives on in justified infamy. While best known for his chilling tales of being caught up in a deadly web of paranoia, power, and the absurdity of bureaucratic complexities, Kafka could also startle and seduce with succinct sublimity and The Complete Stories, containing the bulk of his narrative work aside from his major novels, is an incredible testament to his genius. Truth be told, I’ve long dreamed of wanting to film a biopic about Kafka, except it would be set in the late 70s with Kafka as the frontman for a East European punk band (call them Franz and the Prauge Daugs) instead of a writer. All his stories would instead by covers of Lady Gaga songs off Fame Monster (hear me out: Bad Romance but its The Trial singing ‘you and me caught in the guver’me-ent’ and the whole chanting bit is him just shouting out his own name ‘Franz Franz Kaf-kaf-ka! Franz Franz Kafka Franz!’) It writes itself really. You’ve got Dora burning all his demo tapes for him while Max Brod sneaks off with the masters and calls up Columbia Records or whatever. Anyways, I’m getting away from the point and that is: Franz Kafka is truly inspiring with an imagination that stretches out far beyond his word count or pages, shakes hands with the readers own sense of creativity, and nestles forever in your heart to narrate the dark shadows of life or anxious bureaucratic nightmares you may encounter. Containing his well known tales like The Metamorphosis, A Hunger Artist, In The Penal Colony, or The Judgement—which Kafka considered his greatest breakthrough—and the entirety of his short tales (many of them bordering on flash fiction), The Complete Stories is an indispensable volume brimming with brilliance with every turn of the page."
The Complete Stories,5,"April 13, 2023","The idea that there exists such thing as a “must read” book is one of the great fallacies diluting literature. To judge a reader unfavourably because a certain book is not on his or her shelf, rather than to praise and learn from the idiosyncratic choices to be found there instead, is to wish for a literature of bland homogeneity. To label a book “must read” is to condemn it to being misunderstood. And when that book is by the strange, reclusive, haunted black-humourist Franz Kafka, and is given to students to pour over with grave seriousness for hints of political allegory or prophecy, the misunderstanding is so pronounced as to be, in itself, “Kafkaesque”."
The Complete Stories,5,"January 27, 2018","Anyway, “Before the Law” is a short and great example of one of the many sides a Kafkaesque universe has."
The Complete Stories,5,"May 15, 2018","Updike mentions in the beginning the term Kafkaesque originated from his novels. I anticipate reading these three novels and have ordered them already. I also look forward to reading Kafka’s journals, which also make way to me in the mail. He has an unbelievable way with words. He’s the first writer to take me into another world without creating another world. He has no Hobbits or Aes Sedai, no hybrid man-creatures or Spider-Morph babies eating their mothers when they drop from the womb. He speaks of a normal world but through the lens of his mind, and it transforms into a beautiful place."
The Complete Stories,5,"September 18, 2018","Trying to review Kafka without simply resorting to a string of tired adjectives (claustrophic, absurd, paranoid, circuitous, nightmarish, labyrinthine, despair-inducing, paradoxical) is a task about as futile as any to be found in a Kafka story—but then again, what is any review of a great book if not an exercise in futility? You don’t need me to tell you Kafka is great, because you know Kafka is great, because everyone knows Kafka is great, and on and on forever. Even if you’ve never read him, the name probably evokes images of an unfortunate man being turned into an insect or tortured in a penal colony or tried for a crime no one will say. You know when a situation is “Kafkaesque,” just as you know when it’s Orwellian or Lovecraftian or Dickensian or Shakespearean. (Side note: ever wonder why women writers are never given the name-as-descriptor treatment? Why no Austenesque or Woolfian?) When the culture is saturated with an artist’s influence like it is with Kafka’s, it can seem almost redundant to experience that artist’s work firsthand. What else can there possibly be to glean?"
The Complete Stories,4,"September 28, 2007","Most people's exposure to Kafka consists entirely of ""The Metamorphosis"", which is a shame, for while that story is indeed a classic, it has led to a somewhat unfair pigeonholing of Kafka as a lonely, disillusioned Oedipal case with a penchant for bleak imagery (hence the adjective Kafkaesque). But while Kafka certainly is all of those things, he is also much more, and this collection is a brilliant portrait of that."
The Complete Stories,5,"May 17, 2018","Perhaps rightly so. After all, software is designed to aid not to befuddle, and to disperse existential angst not to replicate it on paper. Although, it’s a toss-up which of computer-esque or Kafkaesque better describes the alienation of man from mankind."
The Complete Stories,5,"December 1, 2010","Simply brilliant, this large (is it truly complete?) collection of stories gives the reader the full measure of Kafka's feeling and writing. From the long stories, which include The Trial (the Judgement), The Metamorphosis, and In the Penal Colony, to the short writ, Kafka evokes a universe where the human is just a cog in a machine. His apt depiction of the corrupt and ruthless law system led to the creation of the English adjective kafkaesque---a modern ""abandon hope all ye who enter here."" Commenting on any individual work would not do the others justice, so I invite you to just start reading."
The Complete Stories,5,"June 26, 2019","But Kafka's short stories are even more 'Kafkaesque' than his novels. I read some of these pieces when I was 15 or 16 and they affected me strongly. Re-reading them I was amazed at how great they truly are -- even better than I remember them. The less well known stories ('Description of a Struggle', 'Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor', 'Josephine the Singer', etc) are no less beautiful, awkward and astounding than his more famous tales ('Metamorphosis', 'In the Penal Colony', etc)."
The Complete Stories,2,"September 23, 2023",I read Metamorphosis is High school and remember being highly unsettled. Since the world is becoming increasingly more Kafkaesque I thought now would be a good time to dig in deeper to his works.
The Complete Stories,4,"February 5, 2017","If you're wondering what ""Kafkaesque"" means, this is where you find out."
The Complete Stories,2,"January 6, 2025","Kafka is clearly a weird ass fucking depressed dude and I get why he didn’t want his shit published. Whatever, his story In The Penal Colony is brilliant and should receive more praise than the revered Metamorphosis. This anthology is bizarre and whimsical and dare I say “Kafkaesque.” Genuinely tiresome to get through and the enjoyment derived from this was few and far between. I read this while in Mexico so maybe I was being a loser idk."
The Complete Stories,3,"July 30, 2012",Understood what the word 'kafkaesque' means...
The Complete Stories,4,"July 9, 2023",Kafkaesque…..
The Complete Stories,5,"January 2, 2023","Was Borges Kafkaesque? This collection — with its wide variety of long and short stories — offers the range and depth of stories found in Borges’ Ficcionnes, a marvelous book if ever one existed. Likewise, the depth and breadth of stories covered in Kafka’s The Complete Stories contain everything (from scrap paragraph to 50-page short story/novella) Max Brod was told to burn but didn’t. Despite the incompleteness of the works (or indeterminacy with what was to be done with his as yet unpublished works had he lived longer), if lost, the world of literature would be far the worse. It is unimaginable to find so many unusual stories, perspectives from the living (ape, dog, burrowing rodent, bug/beetle), interpretations of literary figures and historical monuments — all singular and with his uncanny voice. Many of these stories required rereading during this attempt, and two longer stories, “The Metamorphosis” and “Investigations of a Dog” were second readings; they felt like new works as indeed they were different translations. And I could come back to them again and again I am sure."
The Complete Stories,5,"July 14, 2025","I forget if it's this one I read or some other collection. I mean what is there to say about kafka that hasn't already been said, it's quite kafkaesque. My favorite story is Blumfeld, an elderly bachelor which kafka wrote about in his diary as a ""a fish barely breathing on a sandbank"""
The Complete Stories,5,"February 2, 2022","To borrow words from Albert Camus, ""The whole of Kafka's art consists in compelling the reader to reread him."" Camus might be right [there is no other writer I think who has read Kafka to such extents] because there is a sense of incompleteness a reader essentially feels on reading Kafka. But it is not something that Kafka intentionally infuses into his works. It is only that the reader feels with growing desperation, that in the finiteness of Kafka's work there are many things beyond bounds, and in one read, one can only grasp enough. Sometimes, the reader feels Kafka himself is exposed quite unintentionally to this absurd abundance and is overwhelmed. After writing ""The Judgment'' sitting throughout the night Kafka notes in his diary: ""The fearful strain and joy, how the story developed before me as if I were advancing over water...How everything can be said, how for everything, for the strangest fancies, there waits a great fire in which they perish and rise up again.."" Maybe it is because of this, that many associates the expression Kafkaesque with a labyrinth, in which one has to take absolute care not to get lost and come out of with something, and upon doing so only to realize you know nothing of the maze, but only the path you so laboriously traversed, that too only in bits and pieces."
The Complete Stories,5,"January 11, 2018","I'm not a literary expert, but to me, Kafka is like Melville--at times a genius, and at other times just plain totally wacked-out. ""The Village Schoolmaster"" is is like something scribbled down on sheets of paper by a person confined to an insane asylum. On the other hand, ""In the Penal Colony"" and ""The Metamorphosis"" are two of the most brilliant stories of the 20th century. Most of his stories are closer to genius than crazy, or a mixture of each. I would recommend reading this book by flipping from story to story. There's never been a greater time in the history of the world to delve into the Kafkaesque."
The Complete Stories,4,"May 7, 2021","Kafkaesque. The first time I head the phrase was while watching Breaking Bad but the reference went right over my head. Eventually I heard of Kafka again, this time through classic literature lists, one thing led to another and I delved into Kafka's quintessentially Kafkaesque novel, The Trial. That still left arguably his most famous work, The Metamorphasis. I resisted. I loathe short stories and dread collections of short stories. I also couldn't help myself. Kafka's one of many with the title of 'master of the short story'."
The Complete Stories,5,"August 9, 2023","I reread this book again to give it a chance to see for sure if it was me or the book that was lacking. Certainty it was me. The stories in here are nothing but intersting kafkaesque, short witty and humorously fun to read that begs my mind wanting kafka to write full novels on these."
The Complete Stories,3,"November 7, 2017","400 pages of aimless nihilism, some of it morbidly fascinating, some of it overwrought academic garbage. Worth reading if only for the sake of understanding what the word ""Kafkaesque"" means."
The Complete Stories,4,"June 2, 2019","Reviewing a complete collection of any author is always something of a false-starter, as, unless your intention is to specifically review the editing, translation, and structuring of the text, the work is either a total survey or an attempt to summarise an entire career. I will attempt no such thing. Rather, reading through this collection (a slow but rewarding affair) allowed me an understanding and insight into Kafka, a man whose name has become several degrees more ubiquitous than anything he ever wrote (and I’d include ‘Metamorphosis’ in that assessment). The primary revelation is probably in the slight misdefinition of what ‘Kafkaesque’ means. Popularly it is understood to refer to stories or events that suggest a claustrophobic, bureaucratic oppression by arcane and contradictory systems that spiral in and around one’s person until you are left constricted, alienated, and alone. All of these things are, of course, common mainstays in Kafka’s short stories (and as I understand, his novels even more so). But what this definition misses is the comedy of Kafka, and the occasionally benign absurdism of his work. Anxiety and despair might appear often, but so too do strange jokes and talking animals and bouncing balls. Indeed, despite his one-note (popular) appreciation, Kafka’s stories reveal a remarkable variety, in both narrative voice, setting, and structure, even if he returns to many central themes. The fragmentary work and some of the unpublished stories are, perhaps naturally, of a somewhat lower quality (or more simply incomplete and indecipherable), but their inclusion is necessary according to the nature of the volume. But the best stories (my favourite being ‘The Great Wall of China’, a truly superlative work), these more than make up for any slack in reading; they earn the man his name."
The Complete Stories,4,"November 11, 2020","For me, most of the published longer stories felt more fully realized and complete, whereas most of the unpublished ones felt incomplete (and sometimes entire pages or fragments were missing). My favorites from the longer stories were ""The Metamorphosis,"" ""In the Penal Colony,"" ""A Hunger Artist,"" and ""A Report to an Academy."" These are all well-crafted stories that illustrate the meaning of the term 'Kafkaesque.' The shorter stories were more of a mixed bag - they range from 4-5 pages to a single paragraph in length - and many of them read like parables or fables."
The Complete Stories,4,"October 26, 2022","I have often heard the adjective Kafkaesque, never knowing exactly what it meant, but being aware it was not a compliment. After reading this collection of his short stories, I have a pretty good understanding of what the term means. Much like Shakespeare tragedies, a happy ending is not expected in any of these stories. Though, the stories are not happy-go-lucky, Kafka’s writing style is extraordinary, and it doesn’t take much searching to find one’s own experience in these stories. The Metamorphosis, is the most famous, but there others that are worthy of recognition: The Penal Colony, Country Doctor, A Hunger Artist, and The Bridge are a few that stood out to me. Many of his stories are written from the viewpoint of animals: dogs, apes, mice, and bugs. One story is written from the viewpoint of a bridge."
The Complete Stories,5,"November 19, 2024","The whole collection of Kafka's shorter works, including the Metamorphosis, arguably his most famous work. It is absolutely amazing. Kafka brings out his talents in many of the stories herein with themes of alienation, arbitrariness and meaninglessness in social structures, unsatisfied desires in making genuine connections, and the indifference of people towards others when those others cannot advance them. Of course, some people dislike the bleakness of the Kafkaesque but it does reflect some of the social problems of society. There are some stories collected in this book which are clearly better than others, but getting and reading the collection as a whole is a worthwhile endeavor."
The Complete Stories,4,"October 26, 2023","Overall, I liked these much more than I had expected. There's more than a touch of magical realism, surrealism, or the absurd. And Kafka is much funnier than I had supposed (or than I remember from reading The Trial a long time ago). I'm tempted to pick up The Castle, but in no rush. I also have for a long time thought I knew what people meant by ""Kafkaesque,"" and I still do have a sense of what they mean by it, but it doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do with what's in these stories."
The Complete Stories,5,"May 17, 2023","So, here we have the complete stories, generally considered the peak of Kafka’s legacy, where we get “Kafkaesque.” There are the great stories, generally complete’ish, the fragments, some of which don’t quite work, the very, VERY long ones, which sometimes overstay their welcome (to this reader), and the unexpected (to me) host of VERY short “flash fiction” of which, I’m sure, Kafka was a pioneer. Here we find his unique blend of humor, everyday tragedy, poignancy, people striving to get by, understand their place in a hostile, rigid, inexplicable world, with that creepy, largely unacknowledged hostility coming from SOMEWHERE. Reader’s note: I would recommend following John Updike’s advice in the Introduction and skipping the two long stories that begin the collection: “Descriptions of a Struggle” and “Wedding Preparations in the Country” which, to this reader, are largely incomprehensible and fragmentary and could put a lot of readers off from the treasures to follow."
The Complete Stories,3,"October 23, 2021","Reading this collection I naturally had to look up the word “Kafkaesque,” a term I’d heard many times. It’s roughly defined as the description of a confusing and frightening or nightmarscape."
The Complete Stories,4,"September 4, 2023","Other than his three long novels and his diary/correspondence, this is the rest of everything Kafka wrote that has remained past his death. There are some pretty good short stories in here and the Kafkaesque atmosphere is generally present throughout. He's such an enigmatic author that I remain completely intrigued by him and will probably read everything else out there that I haven't yet. He's not my favorite author or anything, but there's something I can't explain that draws me to read his stuff and know him better through what he wrote. If I ever write, I hope to incorporate a bit of his style into my own and leave readers pondering a deeper meaning. Recommend to any."
The Complete Stories,5,"January 30, 2024",Gimme more Kafkaesque stories:
The Complete Stories,3,"July 27, 2018","This collection didn’t need to be quite so complete, if you know what I mean. When his stories are good they are really really good, and when they are bad...well usually that means they are unfinished or unrevised, but man are they hard to get through. I made myself read it cover to cover but there were a couple stories in the middle I wanted to skip. However, I really enjoyed the collection of ‘shorter stories’ in the back. They are all very compact and have that surreal, unsettling quality which makes you realize where the term “Kafkaesque” actually came from."
The Complete Stories,3,"July 15, 2020","Bu anlamda öykünün yüklendiği iddia edilen sembolizmle, karşılığında kopan fırtınanın yine Kafkaesque bir tezat oluşturduğunu düşünmeden edemiyorum."
The Complete Stories,4,"October 16, 2020",You have to read this one if you ever plan to use the phrases kafkaesque.
The Complete Stories,4,"July 12, 2011","Speaking of acknowledging things, allow me to tell you a few things that I've heard over the years when Kafka's been mentioned. They are things like ""grossly depressing,"" ""heavy,"" ""intellectually stimulating,"" and ""Kafkaesque,"" the last of which seems to be the most duh-worthy of statements. Reading Kafka ""for fun"" has been interpreted to me as the kind of thing that either Extreme Brains or Insufferable Faux-Artsy-Fartsy Sorts do and although I am hardly the sort to say that I'm able to confirm such things, neither am I capable of saying that I tried to deny them as I approached the book. Kafka's Complete Stories felt scary to me; that's why it took me a month and some-odd days to be able to muster up the courage to attack the gross bulk of the collection head-on. It didn't help that the editors positioned ""Description of a Struggle,"" which is quite possibly one of Kafka's most daunting short stories, as the first full-length ""long story"" in the collection. A few days of attempting to negotiate ""Description""'s preponderance for dicking around with stream-of-consciousness, unreliable narrators, and fantasy-horror motifs blending into a puddle of what-the-fuckery and I told myself that it would be okay to take The Complete Stories as a story-by-story basis and relegated it to ""Book for the Whole Summer"" status."
The Complete Stories,5,"July 13, 2024","His best is incredible. “Metamorphosis” is an undeniable triumph. “A Hunger Artist” and “In the Penal Colony” are also magnificent. Based on previous limited understanding, I thought “Kafkaesque” described an absurd and cruel situation. This is true, but I wasn’t expecting the sympathy in each story. The most surprising part of “Penal Colony” is how human the executioner seems by the end of the story. Because of my own taste, I enjoyed the more coherent stories than the dream-visions of “A Country Doctor” or “A Description of a Struggle” (yikes)."
The Complete Stories,5,"March 9, 2024","I found Kafka’s work to be sometimes enigmatic and cryptic, while other times the meaning would hit me like a freight train. At the beginning of each story, I’d be on the edge of my seat, wondering if this would be one that left me puzzled or feeling seen in a newfound way. His stories are unique and human and fearless, and arguably a genre in and of itself. I mean, they literally coined the term “Kafkaesque” after the guy. Delving into this world-renowned writer’s work has been quite the experience that I’m sure I’ll find myself coming back to again and again. I think it’s also worth noting that many of the stories in this collection were not published during Kafka’s lifetime and were, therefore, unfinished. It took me a while to adapt to the fact that not every story was going to be as polished as some of the others, or even completed for that matter, and so I encourage anyone else who picks up this collection to keep that in mind."
The Complete Stories,4,"December 8, 2012","Until you read Kafka, many of us think we know Kafka based perhaps on anecdotal items we pick up in the media or from others. The mere fact there's the term ""Kafkaesque"" perhaps causes us to think we know what it means. But it is only when one reads Kafka do you begin to gain some insight into one of the most mysterious and yet hallowed writers of the 20th century."
The Complete Stories,2,"May 2, 2021","One reoccurring theme I noticed from Kafka's stories is the use of anthropomorphism in several of his stories. Outside of The Metamorphosis, Kafka has several of his stories from the perspective of animals providing 1st person narration. Therefore the world described becomes Kafkaesque, as it is both deceptively human while remaining alien. Lastly, I found A Report to an Academy and interesting story as an inversion of The Metamorphosis. In A Report Kafka details the story of an ape gaining human consciousness and shedding his apelike qualities to basically become a man, kind of the opposite of Gregor becoming the beetle."
The Complete Stories,5,"January 25, 2020",Kafka is used in a lot of cruel experiments by Lit. teachers to see how Kafka’s style can infect young writers. I don’t think there’s any goal in mind - other than to possibly create more of the Kafkaesque.
The Complete Stories,3,"May 28, 2014","I read ""The Metamorphosis"", ""A Country Doctor"", ""A Hunger Artist"", and parts of ""In the Penal Colony."" I didn't really enjoy Kafka's writing. It's extremely long-winded and features long run-on sentences that go on for paragraph-like lengths. I think it's partially my fault that I didn't particularly like his short stories because I was expecting something allegorical, when his works are probably not meant to be taken in an allegorical sense. Oops! Although his works were seminal at the time of publication, I feel like they aren't that unique now. I've read manga that feel more Kafkaesque than Kafka's works. Maybe I'll understand when I grow up..."
The Complete Stories,5,"December 16, 2020","This is by far my favorite collection of Kafka's short fiction in English. K is obviously an original, central Modern writer. It was especially good to read/re-read the very short pieces (which count as ""flash fiction"" these days). Several of them prefigure Borges. Updike's intro is very good, too.On another topic, Goodread's auto-correct is Kafkaesque."

Brave New World,4,"April 24, 2021","The book is about a man who thought primitive than their so-called advanced society. In the end, it turned out only John is more human than any other person in the kafkaesque society. I think it is a similar situation to the cannibal holocaust where city folks go to see thr cannibalistic tribe in the wild. To see who is more civilized and came to a kinda grim outcome."
Brave New World,5,"August 10, 2024","This book subverted my expectation, believing that the titular brave new world would be a kafkaesque look into a world so oddly different from our own with an underlying commentary of how strange our relationship with work is, instead it was an insight to the balance of pleasure and pain and how short term dopamine rushes leas to an unfulfilling lifestyle. Despite being a classic written nearly a century ago, its lessons are evidently ever more clearly as we abandon skillful pursuits that require patience for a quick fix. It also speaks to what a eugenic society would look like, with people bred and conditioned to be fit into a caste without any ambition to change their place in society. A very good read that only grows in relevance"

Brave New World,4,"April 16, 2017","Huxley is a superb author. He instantly teleports you into this bizarre, almost kafkaesque dystopian world and the book moves at a really fast pace. I really liked Brave New World. There's so much symbolism and thematic depth in the book."
Dead Souls,5,"April 6, 2014","Here are some observations: I was expecting something a lot more psychological and angsty, judging not least from that ominous title but also from having read the almost Kafkaesque The Overcoat. Instead, I get what on the surface seems like your standard Dickensian social satire, specifically launching in at Capitalism 25 years before the spectre of Marx's Capital. I'm immediately reminded here of Our Mutual Friend - the dust heap as pointed metaphor for fleeting lucre (q.v. also JR's penny stocks, further down the line). Chichikov (the name itself is worth a laugh) is some kind of Tzarist 419 scammer, trying to buy up dead serfs, playing a long con which I'll omit so as not to spoil too much. It's surprisingly funny, though - particularly in the second part - the characters start to repeat themselves some."
Dead Souls,4,"January 3, 2022","A bizarre comedy. Chichikov is one of the strangest fellows I’ve come across in literature. A strange and meandering (unfortunately incomplete) heroic epic of Chichikov’s attempts to get rich. It’s a bit Kafkaesque, which isn’t a fair comparison considering he predates Kafka by a wide margin."
Dead Souls,4,"April 9, 2025","Kafkaesque pre-Kafka. Fourth wall breaker pre-KoolaidMan. THE Great Russian Epic (prose) Poem Novel, until eclipsed just one generation later by Dostoy &amp; Tolstoevsky. Like the great Russians he inspires, has a penchant for tedium, but at least funny tedium."
The Complete Yes Minister,5,"December 27, 2018","The finest satire for discerning readers, Yes Minister is a delight from the start to the finish. Working in the Corp world, the Kafkaesque bureaucracy often seems familiar."
Chess Story,4,"December 16, 2020",A very entertaining novella with a Kafkaesque atmosphere. One of confinement and psychological torture. The footnotes included in my edition were very helpful so as to delve into this strange world.
Chess Story,4,"November 10, 2024","What I found most compelling about Chess Story is how Zweig uses the game of chess as a powerful metaphor for life itself—its strategies, its risks, and its mental toll. The way Dr. B.’s obsession with chess slowly erodes his grip on reality is both tragic and poignant. There’s an almost Kafkaesque sense of inevitability in the way his mind deteriorates, consumed by a game that was meant to be a refuge."
Chess Story,3,"March 11, 2021","Is it a short story (quite short, leading to a single conclusion) or a novella (develops two or three characters). I think of this writing as mittelEuropa: the characters behave in a very polite old-world fashion, and worry about the behavior and place in society. The psychological detail is Kafkaesque, as it seems designed to be at once boring and yet build suspense. I can readily imagine this being read aloud some evening around the fireplace, gradually building the suspense. And I could not help wondering about the writer's own frame of mind, as this was his last work before suicide. The three protagonists -- beside the ""objective"" professorial narrator -- are described as sharply distinct emotional and intellectual people, each engaged in their own attempt to check and mate their vague inner demons. Who wins? The plodding idiot savant, presented as having little intellect or interiority. There's the lesson -- don't think too much; it'll drive you to..."
the burrow,5,"July 31, 2015","The question still remains of how we moles, living painfully in the jungle, can find our peace of mind. Somehow the platitude “just make the best of what you have” is underwhelming given the fact Kafka wrote this while dying of tuberculosis, with his sisters being sent to concentration camps shortly after his death. Perhaps then the burrow is not an attempt at escaping from reality, but from the nightmare of our consciousness—to guard against not just others but ourselves. In this way, perfectly Kafkaesque, salvation is denied to us. No matter where you turn, inward or outward, friend or foe, accomplishment or failure: everything seems to arrive at a dead end."
The Delicate Prey and Other Stories,5,"January 31, 2021","Marvelous, Kafkaesque stories, mostly about the decay of reason, which I take to be Bowles' favorite theme."
The Good Soldier vejk,4,"January 8, 2020","In a nutshell, this is a biting satire and damning commentary on the tragically dehumanising yet farcical (the source of the humour that propels this journey from beginning to end) effect of state and bureaucratic mechanisms upon the individual. By placing this story during the heightened states of nations at war, this satire is able to live and breathe through the people that are affected by the Kafkaesque hyper-reality that ensues at such times."
Notes from Underground White Nights The Dream of a Ridiculous Man and Selections from The House of the Dead,4,"June 29, 2022","People; their attitudes, facial expressions, words and other things… According to Fyodor, everything about human existence has a meaning. The book draws the reader into Kafkaesque despair. It leaves them with an endless tangle of analyzes that make one wonder ""if I am in Sartre's ""Nausea"" world"" from time to time."
2666,5,"October 28, 2013","In fact, Nabokov and Bolaño have a great deal in common, particularly in their fascination with nationalism and national identity. Nabokov, we remember, was born into Russian nobility before the revolution of 1917, some time after which he emigrated to Berlin, and eventually to the United States where he was naturalized; most of his books preceding Lolita are in some way Kafkaesque and explore the arbitrariness and identity effacement central to the modern state apparatus."
2666,5,"January 20, 2023","The final chapter does wrap it all up and ties the major threads together, yet Bolaño also introduces a brand new territory. Here, Bolaño writes a story of early to mid-century Germany and Europe, introducing another tall German character, Hans Reiter, who after WWII takes on the identity of Benno von Archimboldi. This last chapter is structured as a künstlerroman, tracing the path of Reiter from childhood to adulthood, documenting his love of books, his time as a soldier fighting during WWII in Poland and Russia, and living in Germany, Europe, and the Mediterranean after the war. In many ways this chapter reminds me of Curzio Malaparte’s ""Kaputt,"" a Kafkaesque novel about the end of the war told from the perspective of the Axis powers. It also reminds me of Thomas Mann’s post-WWII novel, ""Doctor Faustus,"" which looks rather balefully at the failure of Germany and the Nazi project. The künstlerroman functions as an anchor point that allows Bolaño to spin out many more narrative lines. A key moment for Reiter/Archimboldi, while as a soldier retreating from Russia and Poland, is the discovery in an abandoned Polish village of the papers of Boris Abramovich Ansky, a Jewish writer and theoretician, who tells the sorry tale of another Russian writer, who falls afoul of Stalin: artist’s story within artist’s story within artists’s story. After the war, Reiter become Archimboldi, begins to write novels, finds a supportive publisher and, over time, a reading public. As a writer, or it might be better to say as an adult, Archimboldi leads an itinerant and nearly invisible life around Europe and the Mediterranean, and few know how to contact him, parallels to Pynchon again. Bolaño also tells the story of Archimboldi’s sister Lotte and her son Klaus Haas, who is being scapegoated for the femicides in Santa Teresa. Through the three characters, Bolaño links the Old and New World stories of the novel: the violence of the modern world resonates with the violence of the old. Just like in the other chapters, there are many more stories, resolved and unresolved, connected and independent, that Bolaño spins in this chapter, leading to an ending that could be read as hopeful."

Some commentators have noted that the NSA’s reach and scope is more Kafkaesque than it is Orwellian. But what do we even mean by Kafkaesque? It’s often used to describe a system or situation marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity but Frederick R.

It would make you cringe till the end and for weeks after that. This book has so much relevance now, even Orwell at one point thought that what he imagined in 1949 didn't turn out the same and agreed that he was wrong, but now we can see glimpses of it all coming true in countries like china. Which is truely kafkaesque and Orwellian both at the same time. A timeless read. A must read."
1984,4,"January 10, 2023","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Franz Kafka, George Orwell too has a word to his credit in English language. Orwellian situation has come to mean a dystopia. Kafkaesque things are confusing. You are not clear about why, what and how of happenings and it fills you with desperation, makes you to resign to way of things 'like a dog'. But in Orwellian state, you come to know what is happening, why is it happening and how. Still you will not able to escape depression, feeling of gut wrenching helplessness and terror. Both writers make you feel guilty about taking for granted simple intellectual pleasures like reading and writing. 1984 makes you appreciate liberty and freedom and instils fear of totalitarianism in your heart. It's all that I can say to make you read this book without spoiling the experience of reading it as author intended it to be read."

Such a simple magical basis or rule has been twisted under nightmarish Kafkaesque systems and bureaucracies into a sort of lovecraftian inscrutability that seeks to oppress and erase consciousness."
1984,4,"December 14, 2020","1984 is a chilling portrayal of a dystopian future which is plagued with constant surveillance of every possible action and thought. Very much Kafkaesque in its narrative, the novel compels the reader to question the meaning and the varying faces of truth."

1984,5,"August 7, 2020","Nineteen Eighty-Four has given its name to a social syndrome: ‘Orwellian’. Like ‘Kafkaesque’, it originates in one of those rare novels which have framed public discourse. But when the novel first came out, in June 1949, it made no great impact. Secker and Warburg, its publisher, printed barely enough to satisfy the public library market. One of the things reviewers complained about was that, as a work of science fiction, which is how it was interpreted at the time, Nineteen Eighty-Four was lamentably unimaginative. There were no time travellers, no ray guns, no Triffids. History has proved the novel was hugely prophetic in one sense – the power of TV, still latent in 1949. This was something contemporary reviewers and readers largely missed. Orwell foresaw a television which watches you, creating a ‘soft’ surveillance tyranny. ‘Orwellian’ was a term ubiquitously drawn on in the furore about the WikiLeaks and Snowden revelations in 2010 and 2013."

The things are getting more and more gloomy, and in the end you feel nothing but loathing. Yet, reading this book is an important experience. It shows, in its grotesque form, the ulcers a society can get if it neglects developing its institutions; not to mention many terms and metaphors invented by Orwell: doublespeak, thoughtcrime, Big Brother, etc. Those abstractions, however kafkaesque they are, help to reason even about current events. If everyone will read and embrace this book, our future will be safe, at least from totalitarian states."

The Passion According to G H ,4,"December 15, 2013","All G.H. experienced took place within a short time frame, all in one room, but it was somehow spread out over 200 pages. Although I haven’t read much Kafka, I would say that this book did have a Kafkaesque tone to it, especially towards the end. Lispector’s writing style is spellbinding and poetic. This is one of those books I would need to re-read in order to fully appreciate its brilliance."
The Passion According to G H ,4,"July 24, 2014","It's tempting to make the obvious comparison with another giant of Jewish modernist literature and call it a Metamorphosis in reverse; right down to the bit where the woman only identifies herself by her initials, because how fucking Kafkaesque is that? At the same time, this is another age, another climate, and much like she does in (the even better novel) Agua viva Lispector is in no hurry to tell a story here. The entire novel takes place over one morning, with only one character in it (if you don't count the cockroach, and the reader to whom the novel is, by necessity, addressed), all of it written in a feverish, impressionistic language that doesn't try to pass itself off as a finished argument but as one in the making, trying to put words on things that we refuse to acknowledge."
The Passion According to G H ,3,"July 22, 2013","Based on the first 70 pages or so, I would have given this beautiful book at least 4 stars. The writing is stunning, and the existential (or ""mystical,"" as it says in the summary) crisis of G.H. is raw, genuine, and sports a certain Kafkaesque quality (the cockroach: surely an intentional nod?)."
The Passion According to G H ,3,"May 27, 2021","Nowadays, it has become common knowledge the psychological concept of the five steps of grief. Lispector, in this book, tries to implement a concept of the five steps of passion: disgust, tolerance, identification, contemplation and, finally, passion itself. All this through a kafkaesque epiphany (or would it be an anti-epiphany?), picturing the cockroach as the symbol of a nasty, almost evil thing. But, contrary to what Kafka proposed, the protagonist doesn't suddenly transforms her body into an insect and starts to suffer mistrust and contempt from the others. Instead, G.H., the female protagonist in this book, slowly transforms herself mentally, spiritually, into a cockroach. And, by doing so, she begin to question many aspects of her life, sometimes in a certain pressing, repetitive, way, I must say."
The Passion According to G H ,5,"April 12, 2024","It's an uncomfortable position to be in, and the novel is an uncomfortable read. But that's entirely the point. It's full of filthy, disgusting, horrific, abject imagery that recalls the most difficult books of the Old Testament. It's as much the passion of Christ as the apocalypses of Isaiah and Ezekiel. It's an absurd, Kafkaesque, psychosexual fever dream. But to simply reduce it to such almost feels disingenuous, like the work is (in the words of the back cover of this edition) ""genuinely shocking"" and nothing more. After all, is not the reduction of the work to its shock value simply a traditional reduction of Latin American artistic culture more generally? Isn't there more to it than that?"
The Passion According to G H ,3,"October 13, 2021","I will admit, the first word that came to mind when I started this book was ""Kafkaesque,"" and not just because of the whole ""roach as one of the main characters"" arc. This is a weird, wondrous book that I'll probably have to revisit some time in order to really get, but I enjoyed it the first time around even if I'm not rating it higher than three stars. Sometimes my first experience with an author is like that, not exactly a game-changer but something that puts me on notice that ""this writer is in my wheelhouse."" So yes, at some point I will re-read this, and I will also start dipping into her other novels and maybe even the huge collected stories book available. Because Clarice Lispector is perhaps the linkage between Kafka and Roberto Bolano, at least from my initial impression of her work. And those are two of my favorite authors."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"August 20, 2014","At various times, this was magical-realism, murder mystery, sci-fi, political thriller, romance (not too much, thankfully!), Kafkaesque, premature mid-life crisis story, surrealist, spiritual allegory, horror/ghost story, hints of Lolita, and the narrator likens a high-tech hotel to something out of Star Wars... It might have been easier to consider what it was not."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"September 15, 2007","Dance Dance Dance is a bizarre, Kafkaesque tale about a lonely man who embarks on a journey to find a former lover who has called out to him in a dream, only to find himself drawn into a surreal world full of offbeat characters and strange events. While not as hauntingly beautiful as Norwegian Wood, it's great and fascinating stuff, full of style, filmic descriptions and endearing characters. It reads like a film, and that's a compliment in my book."
Dance Dance Dance,3,"December 22, 2019","So far, this has been the most disappointing Murakami book that I have read. The novel began on a usual style like all his other books, however, there was something in this book that just didn’t go well with me. The novel is the last instalment to The Rat series, and it begins with the protagonist going back to the mysterious Dolphin Hotel to unravel himself and his unconscious. Soon, a cohort of characters from myriad backgrounds are thrown into the story to create a mayhem of plots that resonates the title aptly. As we unite each knot, Murakami delves us into the layers of meanings and relationships developing between his characters. The friendship between two thirty-four year old men over the shared feeling of unsettlement and quest for finding love as they age, a blunt yet responsible bond between a thirteen year old girl and a thirty-four year old man, and a love story blossoming patiently amidst all the hullabaloo. It took an unbelievably long time to finish a book by one of my favourite writers and I am afraid. I hope I am not tiring of my beloved author, Murakami and his Kafkaesque, existentialist premise. On the contrary, I do know why I took forever to finish this book, my country is at the brink of fascism and I remember spending a day only getting angry and being unable to read a page. Nonetheless, it is Murakami’s birthday next month, and I will read a book of his to celebrate and get over this nagging fear."
Dance Dance Dance,5,"March 6, 2020","-Specifically in this book the setting of the Dolphin Hotel is exciting. It is, at times, a surrealist Stephen King story. There are thematic references to large bureaucratic systems throughout. One of our narrators friends constantly mentions an expense account. The Dolphin hotel is bought by a large company as part of a huge expansion plan. At another point detectives ""arrest"" the narrator and run him through series of complicated questioning for several days. Before you can say Kafkaesque, Murakami cuts you off when his narrator tells the detectives he was just reading a book: ""You won't believe me when I say I was reading 'The Trial.'"" As in Kafka's writing, these systems are horrible, not just from their inscrutability, but because of the way they sever social connections and prevent human interaction. For Murakami the dreamy underworlds of his story are more real than the systems that undergird the real world. The story would be lonesome if our main character were not building these connections throughout, against the seeming odds that are stacked against each budding relationship by the world around them."
Dance Dance Dance,5,"September 6, 2023","“ Dance Dance Dance “ is another great work of Murakami, based on Kafkaesque, spirituality, supernaturals, magic realism - a typical Murakami masterclass. Everything is interconnected, sooner or later when the time is perfect,it will reveal by itself."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"May 4, 2019","This book left me somewhat confused, satisfied, unsatisfied and unsure at the same time. I guess It has a Kafkaesque touch. Somewhat political, surreal. The story is odd but intriguingly so, with hints of romance and crime. The end leaves you guessing whether this is really it or is there more coming in his next book. Would definitely recommend it! Definitely not my last Murakami."
Dance Dance Dance,5,"July 22, 2022","such a glorious story that keeps me turning to the next page to learn more about what is going on. I'm fully invested in it while reading and it's been quite an adventure. the author never stops to amaze, this is a combination of Kafkaesque-ness with gripping events, and as always i love the way the lines go deep into portraying melancholy thoughts and feelings and emotions as something tangible and vague, clear and deformed, chaotic but realistic, graphic but dreamlike, all at the same time."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"February 8, 2025","if it weren’t for the exhausting quality lent to this book by the (very on the nose) kafkaesque, i’d give it five stars. i liked the characters (especially yuki, the beautiful but sullen thirteen year old girl, and the jokes the narrator kept making about her bra) and the character-building. i liked how full of cultural references it was. i liked how it explicitly named “late stage capitalism” as a villain. great."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"September 28, 2015","First of all, this is a very strange book and is not for everyone. I like it because it's Murakami and there is no one like him. When you read some of his work, you'll now what i mean. This book also works as a standalone novel and you don't need to read Rat trilogy to understand it. You can't put this book in any type of genre. It has magical-realism/murder mystery/romance/Kafkaesque/sci-fi/surrealism, but all of this genres are put there to make you blind. That is all superficial. Real meaning beneath all that is loneliness and emptiness that most people feel and their search for true love and true understanding of why are they here."
Dance Dance Dance,4,"September 16, 2019","The fourth book in ""The Rat"" trilogy follows some of the characters last seen in A Wild Sheep Chase on a tale which wanders in and out of 1980s Japan and a dreamlike world, where events in the plot may or may not have actually happened. With a film actor as a major character that frequently recurring border between reality and imagination becomes hazier than usual. Murakami draws rudderless and rootless men well, but has a less sure hand when creating female characters. Here, as in several of his books, they tend to be over-sexualised ciphers. And yet, as your heart sags at certain scenes, the plot and atmosphere moves along and builds in his Kafkaesque world, that keeps drawing me back to his books."
Dance Dance Dance,3,"January 7, 2016","I found it difficult to warm to any of the characters and wonder why Murakami insists on listing every alcoholic drink and every sexual encounter of his protagonist. Nevertheless, the story does grab you and has Kafkaesque qualities. The climax and denouement is a fizzer....but I wonder if it's meant to be that way as a final comment on the lack of true gratification during 80s advanced capitalist period when the story was set?"
Dance Dance Dance,4,"November 14, 2012","A fine book, with the same melancholic undertone that I know from his other works, but also with a lot of humour in it (the main character has a knack for dry observations and sarcastic dialogue responses). There's a great Kafkaesque scene involving a police questioning, and it had some nice noir touches that reminded me of the work of David Lynch."
Dance Dance Dance,5,"July 18, 2015","I was kinda disappointed. It was strange, confusing, Kafkaesque, etc, but not quite like the insanity of Kafka on the Shore."
Dance Dance Dance,5,"March 4, 2015",Don't think I've ever read a bad Murakami. This one is in keeping with that tradition. Very Kafkaesque in that seemingly 'regular' people find themselves in strange circumstances
Death in Venice,5,"May 24, 2025","There are so many other aspects I love about this, the unreliable narration, the Greek myth references, the Kafkaesque gaslighting of Aschenbach when he realizes the onset of cholera in Venice. It’s a masterpiece in pacing and has so many incredible aspects to the prose — highly recommend for anyone interested in the quirks of fin-de-siècle European society."
The Pit and the Pendulum,4,"November 3, 2012",Mr. Virgilio Amolar must have loved Mr. Edgar Allan Poe very much. Mr. Amolar did not explain the relationships of those to history. Mr. Allan Poe did not bother to explain the reason why the narrator was put in the dungeon. It's kinda Kafkaesque though and it is a classic so it can be forgivable. In the same token that I have forgiven Mr. Amolar for not teaching me something that I could still recall after 30 years.
The Pit and the Pendulum,4,"January 1, 2018","One of Poe's darkest and yet one of the least sad. Also, not as scary for me. I think here he has too much going on at once, it kind of removed the believability. I still like it for the general tone it sets. It's also very Kafkaesque. All these seemingly senseless torture programs that go far but not quite enough."
eve s hollywood,4,"February 9, 2022","The critiques of this work are valid (that Babitz seems to be gloating about the incredibly privileged life she’s lived, that she’s conveying an overstuffed yet unfocused case of extreme narcissism, that she’s ignorant of life beyond exorbitant wealth) but it’s too hard to not have fun reading it. She is fully aware of her status and even welcomes the reader to scoff at her, but we also end up laughing along at the complete absurdity of her life as well. She details episodes of her life with a kind of James Joyce stream of consciousness — a school of writing she immediately groups herself into from the Author’s Note — and tags us along in an odyssey of celebrity swimming pools, mysterious Hollywood-borne deaths and the almost Kafkaesque qualities of life that come about when growing up in the strangest city on earth. She’s having her cake and she’s eating it too whether you like it or not. Where Didion famously captured the languid purgatorial qualities of life in Hollywood, Babitz celebrates the endlessly unpredictable party that it is."
The Crying of Lot 49,4,"September 4, 2023","If I were writing academically, I'd say something like 'Pynchon mobilises a Kafkaesque commitment to unknowability, and in so doing imparts a lingering resonance to the unease of his world while aiming a spotlight at the reader's own yearning for the comfort of verifiable truth'. But that would be awful for everyone, so I won't."
The Crying of Lot 49,5,"May 19, 2020","This book is, simply put, a trip into Wonderland. Oedipa Maas (in a subtly Kafkaesque way) wakes up to find herself the executrix of an estate of her ex-boyfriend, and instead of merely routinely going through the actions of executing the will, she finds herself amidst a sea of ""revelations"" in which fantasy is equally mixed with reality, paranoia with sensibility, and madness with sanity. Ones and zeroes, as Pynchon puts it. Occam once astutely noted that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity, and yet when they are, this book is the result."
The Crying of Lot 49,3,"September 23, 2022","Gets a bit too abstract and goes into endless speculation towards the end. A bit Kafkaesque as well, though here the protagonist seems to be lead deeper and deeper out of her own volition, at times appearing to be in a dreamy haze."
The Gunslinger,3,"December 30, 2018","It is fantastic, imaginative ... but inconsistent. Amid moments of brilliance there are also islands of abstraction so murky, almost Kafkaesque in absurdity, that I could not follow. But it is interesting enough that I will probably read the sequels."
The Gunslinger,3,"June 20, 2017","However, as the first book in a complex series, the book obviously has some flaws. I like the atmosphere of mystery and open-endings, yet some of the dialogues seem..not organic. Don't get me wrong, I like anything Kafkaesque, complex, and dreamy, and Roland (as well as The Man in Black) fit that role perfectly. But the characterization and dialogues of other characters Roland meets (especially Allie, even Jake at times) feel odd, somehow unnatural. I don't know, maybe as I go along with the following books I'll figure out there's a reason for such characterization. For now, it feels like a really young and ambitious writer's flaws as he had not much experience yet. We'll see."
The Gunslinger,3,"July 5, 2019","An imaginative start to a tale I am itching to continue. Great atmosphere and superior world building, with a Kafkaesque abstraction that has me curiously yearning to know more."
The Gunslinger,2,"October 8, 2017","The author shows no mercy as he plunges the reader immediately into a universe steeped in Arthurian mythology, debauchery, gun fetishism and the supernaturally weird that is as equally mysterious to the reader as the Dark Tower is to Roland. And the writing style and narrative structure that constitutes the novel itself is at times murky and oblique, a semi-surreal style almost Kafkaesque that is imbued heavily with symbolism and abstract imagery, making it very hard to read. Amid the chaos and confusion, however, there are moments of brilliance and clarity that help ease the struggle and pain of reading the novel, but it was still a fight to get to the end. I kinda felt like a Gunslinger myself as I fought to reach the last chapter. =("
Journey to the End of the Night,5,"May 5, 2016",Then after the war he endures a Kafkaesque journey by a boat on which everyone seems to want to inflict physical beatings if not death on him for no visible reason. Africa is his destination and things aren't much better there and it's here in Africa that I started to think this was an anti capitalist novel.
The Death of Ivan Ilych,5,"August 9, 2011","On the one side, one think of of Russian fatalism and perhaps a Kafkaesque sense of the dread inevitability of Ivan's malady. On the other side, I find pity for him in light of what modern medicine might have done for him. Of course, Tolstoy need only have given him stage 4 cancer to have stumped a modern doctor. In the end, I suppose we learn something about death... and about life. This is a very thought provoking read."
The Death of Ivan Ilych,Not rated,"July 21, 2024","Wish this was longer - felt as though the moment at the beggining with pyoter ivanovich and praskovoya was unresolved. But i guess that was not the point really, as it is indeed about the death of Ivan Ilyich. Kafkaesque before Kafka. I would be interested to read this in Russian"
The Big Sleep,5,"August 15, 2022","And therein lies the brilliance of this book, which I also remember in Paul Auster’s novels, though they are of a whole different genre. Like Auster’s novels, here also there are certain significant shifts in the detective genre's character, shifts that inexorably mirror the setting where it was written. Whether overtly criminal or ostensibly lawful, corrupt networks define Chandler's post-Prohibition society, and it is these murky spaces that give the investigator Philip Marlowe his existence. It’s not Kafkaesque at all, however. Marlowe knows the stakes and can struggle to survive. And that’s something you will feel anxious about quite often, even when you know that he can’t possibly die (because it’s the first book in the series)."
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,2,"October 19, 2017",Fine. Modern Kafkaesque I guess. Probably just as well off just watching the movie.
the garden of good and evil pancakes,5,"August 27, 2014","""The Garden of Good and Evil Pancakes"" centers on three people, Cassandra, Kate, and Thomas, who are for some inexplicable reason trapped in a Village Inn restaurant for what seems like an eternity. They pass that time in endlessly inventive ways. They create back-stories and lives for the various employees and customers seated throughout the restaurant. They pass judgment, on themselves and each other. They wax poetic about bathroom graffiti and the romantic implications of burnt bacon. In short, they hold one-another's attention (and that of the reader) while serving their sentence in this Kafkaesque purgatory."
The Stories of John Cheever,Not rated,"June 20, 2025","O City of Broken Dreams: Amateur writer and fulltime bus driver takes family (wife, daughter) on jaunt to NYC after selling his one-act play based upon a colorfully Lynchian local lady - finds it to be a nightmare of dusty corridors, Kafkaesque meetings; the streets a labyrinth and chicken pie at the automats the only solace. Mildly anxiety inducing. I used to be a night bus driver. That's what you remind me of. The stars, I mean, and the grade crossings, and the cattle lined up along the fences. And the girls in the lunch counters. They always looked so pretty."
The Stories of John Cheever,4,"April 20, 2019","John Cheever wrote the quintessential mid-20th century New Yorker story: accounts of upper middle class Americans in the tri-state area leading lives of not so quiet desperation with the whole atmosphere pervaded with family dysfunction and considerable accedia, leavened with occasional doses of humor. Read enough of these stories and the formulaic aspect becomes apparent, but Cheever is such a talented, unpredictable writer that he still manages to regularly interest and surprise. A particular highlight, especially with regard to humor, is ""The Death Of Justina,"" a downright Kafkaesque piece. Cheever was also a great fan of Italy and Rome with several stories set there. He describes the Italian experience eloquently, with obvious affection."

the judgment and other stories,4,"September 23, 2017","Kafka wrote the story on Septy22nd 1912, I read it -by coincidence- on September 22nd 2017, exactly 105 years later. It amazes me how literary ingenuity is still relevant and touching decades and centuries after it was first put on the paper. This is my second read of Kafka - after the brilliant 'metamorphosis ' - and I am starting to sense a commonality that might be the reason behind coining the term Kafkaesque. Kafka shows how we are crushed and transformed by the authority, how the very human self is terminated by the acts of the patriarchal. It shows how weak the human being is. This is brilliant piece."
the judgment and other stories,3,"November 26, 2020",Well now I know why Kafka is Kafkaesque.
the judgment and other stories,5,"October 12, 2015","I had (as usual) high expectations for this one and I wasn't disappointed. I absolutely adore how Kafka writes about law (The Trial is one of my favorite books ever). It's absolutely brilliant, scary and, of course, Kafkaesque (there's not in this entire world a suitable synonym for that word)."
the judgment and other stories,4,"August 14, 2022","Despite Kafka's writing style not possessing much convoluted language it was still difficult for me to follow the events and grasp the message the writer is telling due to the Kafkaesque events. To actually understand what happened, I had to spend more time analyzing the story and researching about the author than reading it, which would normally not be something I would often do but I have exams in a few days and am so finding new ways to procrastinate!"

The City of Joy,5,"September 27, 2015","Much of the scenery of 1960s Calcutta was familiar to me as a tourist earlier this year to an entirely different part of India: the religious cacophony, the slum labor, the baksheesh, the festivals, the filth. Wild traffic, marigolds, eunuchs, kurtas and saris. Truly Kafkaesque bureaucracy. It seems that little has changed in the last fifty years, except that the rickshaws are now auto-rickshaws, and the cases of leprosy have been greatly reduced, with a drug cure widely disseminated for free in the past twenty years."
The Blue Octavo Notebooks,4,"July 19, 2017","The best fiction writers cloak ""thought"" in plots, characters, settings, tonalities, rhythms. They create and hide in aesthetic structures. And yet fiction writers do have explicit thoughts. Here are Kafka's...cryptic, elusive, Kafkaesque."
The Blue Octavo Notebooks,4,"February 18, 2019","This can be viewed as a kind of “Best Of” version of Kafka’s diaries, even though they were written in separate notebooks from the “normal” diaries. The scribblings of the blue octavo notebooks were limited, according to Max Brod, to “literary ideas, fragments and aphorisms (without reference to the everyday world).” I found the book boring at times, as in these notebooks, much more than in the other diaries, Kafka ruminates on religion and spirituality, which just wasn’t what I was drawn to in his writings. Instead, I found that I actually missed the “reference to the everyday world” that fills his other diaries, which I suppose has to do with how the colloquial, the mundane, and the quotidian only add another layer of that elusive “kafkaesque” quality in his writings. So, for example, when we read in the other diaries snippets and starts of what would later become his stories and novels, the act of creation becomes even more alive for the reader because these fragments are juxtaposed against less literary details of the writer’s own life—how much he hates his job, familial strife, relationship problems, health woes, etc."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"January 13, 2012","all Kafkaesque, he becomes a dream-reading blind."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"September 15, 2015","The story unfolds around a man who works for a non-governmental agency—the System—which, in the course of time, has acquired a quasi-official status. The protagonist makes a living as a Calcutec, i.e. as an information encryption specialist. A Calcutec's training essentially consists in establishing some artificial division in the trainee's brain. Once the ""switch"" is implanted, Calcutecs are able to proceed various data, as if they were in a subconscious state of mind—and in a sense, in a subconscious mode of being. Semiotecs are antagonists of Calcutecs. They work for the Factory—a mirror-agency of the System—which employs people to decode stolen data. When the main character gets assigned to a highly sensitive job for a brilliant but nonetheless weird scientist, a Kafkaesque chase begins underneath the labyrinthine streets of Tokyo."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"April 14, 2022","Even though all these looked complicated and so confusing to comprehend, that is not a problem. Murakami novels are almost always kafkaesque and surreal in some way but they make their kind of sense. They all have dream logic attached to them. And I really loved it."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"April 26, 2023","for all fans of franz kafka, i heavily recommend. this novel is the epitome of the term “kafkaesque.”"
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"June 28, 2020","In short, it's a Christopher Nolan movie based in Tokyo with a dash of the Kafkaesque."

Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,1,"August 11, 2013","The back cover calls the novel Kafkaesque. Though intended as praise, it really isn't."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"January 9, 2025","This is classic Murakami yet not really his usual boilerplate stuff, especially the odd chapters with the sci-fi narrative. I could see that his grip on Kafkaesque magical realism is more robust and assertive yet can't help but praise the way he managed to indulge into the 'Hard-Boiled' science stuff that too in the era of pulp fiction. I won't go into the details of the parallel stories in the odd-even fashion but will give you these lines as a food for thought:"
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"June 24, 2018","Murakami's books have always appealed to me; but this book in particular just felt amazing. There's that Kafkaesque feel to it that I love, yes, but there was something else about it too. It was a book that made you think differently about things; about what matters and about what doesn't; about the meaning of life; about love; about death; and for some reason, perhaps because I had encountered it n other literature, that of Alzheimer's and the link between memory and identity - is the loss of one's memory not akin to certain type of death?"
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"June 23, 2021","Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&nbsp;by Haruki Murakami follows two narratives - one a&nbsp;dreamy exploration of the 'subconscious', taking place at the 'End of the World', that is suspended from reality; the other a sentimental but hard&nbsp;analysis of life in 'reality',&nbsp;taking place in underground Kafkaesque Tokyo -&nbsp;and&nbsp;portrays an elegant unfolding of what happens when these two worlds meld together, becoming increasingly familiar with each other."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"March 22, 2018","Murakami's Kafkaesque worlds enraptute and rend. The story is a fascinating tour of a prosaic, magic-laden village &amp; a tired, gritty metropolis. Full of the fantastic &amp; eerie; I couldn't put it down. The image I'll remember most: the Dreamreader drawing out old dreams from skulls."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"May 21, 2024","Described as Kafkaesque, as Sci-Fi or fantasy, as surrealism or a fable and as a postmodern manifesto, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is nothing but Haruki Murakami at his best."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"July 10, 2025","Simply put; This is a book like no other, One of a kind performance from Muarakami to charm us into his original magical postmodern style of fantastical concept..

Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"September 5, 2024","The End of the World narrative, the even chapters, is a completely different Kafkaesque world from a technologically underdeveloped time. In order to enter the Town, which is surrounded by an impenetrable wall, the Gatekeeper has to remove the narrator’s shadow. Shadows hold memories and aren’t allowed in the Town. His Shadow has to live in the shadow grounds outside the walls of the town and do the work of chopping off the heads of dead unicorns and burying their bodies. Without a body, the Shadow isn’t expected to live through the winter. The Shadow tasks the narrator with mapping the Town so they can figure out how to escape it."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"August 7, 2018","Now going in, I thought that this was a book with two novellas or something. But after a shortish (and a bizarre) first chapter, which firmly established it's Kafkaesque credentials, the second book was a different story all together. For a while I thought these were going to be two books with alternate chapters of each. I quickly gave that notion up realizing that would be stupid. But at the outset the chapters were THAT dis-connected."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,Not rated,"September 9, 2020","This book is a classic Murakami and if you are someone who has read his works before you will not be surprised. It’s a mundane tale of a data processor who lives a rather boring life but then again when has Murakami ever kept things that simple or mundane. We are slowly pulled into an utopia where everything is close to perfection and hence quite imperfect and then the story just hurtles you towards a Kafkaesque universe where what you think you know is not what it is at all. Very rarely have I read a tale which swings between two extremes so flawlessly, it is utopia and dystopia, madness and calmness, sex and celibacy, life and death, the birth and end of the world all packaged into a beautiful dreamy trip. This book is definitely not for someone who is expecting to get out of a reading slump because Murakami’s books always tend to slow you down and it might even be construed as confusing and boring for some. However, this is exactly what makes all his novels so special. To fully experience the book one cannot race through the pages, one has to stop and savor all the delicious printed details to get fully committed to “Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World”. When I started reading the book the alternating chapters made me feel like I was reading two completely different novels, one with a brilliant number crunching genius and one with unicorns. The read is so surreal that at times I almost felt like I was floating out of my own head and then slowly the dots started connecting and the connected dots made a path and the path was everything that Murakami is. A pure literary genius who is so unique in his style and storytelling that one can only gasp in awe. “Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” will leave you second guessing your own reality."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"February 13, 2017","This novel is Kafkaesque, a little heart-breaking, and brilliantly designed. It is also quite a genre-bender; it contains elements of mystery, science fiction and magical realism. Pick it up if you want to read something crazy and clever, or if you like Murakami’s sense of humour. Example:"
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"February 24, 2022",Kafkaesque: the two (?) protagonists are trapped in games but the rules are mysterious. Skulls are common to both: the Calcutec is engaged in calculations for a professor who collects them and the Dreamreader’s task is to read old dreams from them. Unicorns are involved; the Dreamreader’s shadow has been excised (shades of Pullman’s His Dark Materials); both are helped by female Librarians. A long journey underground is undertaken—this is a recurring Murakami theme.
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,3,"July 12, 2019","Part Kafka, Part William Gibson but all Murakami this is an enjoyable read. There's a lot going on here. Two stories told in alternate chapters that merge into one. We begin with a cyberpunkish thriller. Then a Kafkaesque fantasy world with its strange rules and impenetrable walls. Then back to the slightly not quite our world world."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"July 18, 2022","Murakami had been recommended to quite a few times and Hard Boiled (etc.) was the singular book of his I had found. The blurb gives little away, and I see why, it really is a “philosophical Kafkaesque post modern manifesto” rolled into one ‘rip roaring’ novel. How could you begin to condense that into a neat paragraph? It confused me a lot of the time but the book has an odd sense of humour that for me alternated somewhere inbetween ‘The Big Lebowski’ and ‘Catcher in the Rye’. It was hard to put down for that reason alone."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,3,"May 16, 2023","Với hai tuyến truyện song song, thoạt đầu chỉ có tuyến truyện của toán sư là đủ hấp dẫn mình vì độ hài hước, tính Kafkaesque, kiểu nhân vật điển hình của Murakami (cô đơn, rượu, jazz, tình dục). Nhưng sau đó, khi thế giới bắt đầu hỗn loạn, buộc chuyến phiêu lưu bắt đầu, cả hai tuyến truyện đều kém hấp dẫn như nhau. Đây là bởi nhân vật đã suy nghĩ, tự sự quá nhiều trong tác phẩm. Một điều cũng đã từng xuất hiện trong Vụ Án của Franz Kafka."

Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"May 22, 2023","It’s effectively two books interwoven into a dynamic piece, you have the hardboiled storyline which takes inspiration from Private detective world of Raymond Chandler; contrasted with the End of the world which is Kafkaesque in nature."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"February 13, 2024","I'm re-reading this book now after devouring it in the early 1990s. Now I'm on a big Murakami re-read and have come to Hard-Boiled Wonderland after his previous books. He has definitely found his voice by now and is also having fun with it, a wonderful stage in an author's development. There's the deadpan cod-sci-fi path, full of characters nonchalantly talking about nonsense and with the very Murakami eccentric young girl who can't keep her hands off the middle-aged Murakami-like protagonist (I'm not a fan of this strain in his work), and there's also the very Kafkaesque alternative story of the town where another protagonist has to read old dreams for no good reason."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"November 5, 2019","In his own, weird, mind-bending way, Haruki Murakami takes the reader on a wild ride through the workings of human consciousness, while successfully combining several different genres, from sci-fi to post-modernism, to detective story. I don't know what to write about this book without giving too much away, so I will just say this: If you are up for a wild, genre-spanning ride with science, magic, unicorns and a free ticket to kafkaesque philosophy, this book is for you."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"February 28, 2021","While I can't define what Kafkaesque means, I can read and tell. And it was obvious from the first page of the book. It's well mixed with Murakami's own style, so it was a nice read for me."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"January 22, 2020","Murakami at his metaphorical best. He's often compared to Kafka, and I don't always see the connection. But Hard-Boiled Wonderland definitely delivers ""Kafkaesque."" This isn't my favorite of Murakami's work (treatment of female characters is especially sexist here) but it is a well-written, complex, and interesting book."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"June 11, 2021","super weird!! but good overall. old murakami definitely had some Orwellian underpinnings to his writing, can def see the Kafkaesque influences especially in this one too. pretty cool that the two parallel narratives could read as entirely separate stories up until close to the very end. 😎"
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"September 16, 2023","My favourite Murakami book. Kafkaesque, grotesque, hilarious and thought-provoking all at once."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"May 4, 2018","I loved it. I don't usually play favourites with books but this is one of the clearest winners. Light in style (i.e. un-heavy) and yet dark in theme, Murakami's foray into the recesses of the human mind is of Kafkaesque proportions. He tingles, he shocks, he bludgeons and leads you on. But most of all he makes you laugh: at the world without and you a part of it, at the world within and you as it and at the world as a part of you both within and without. Elegant, multi-layered and witty, Murakami proves that he is one of the few true successors to Franz Kafka."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"August 15, 2013","Perhaps I’ll try to give a little nugget of encouragement or preview without giving too much away. He writes the novel in alternating storylines, where the odd chapters follow one plot and the even chapters follow another, like Kafka on the Shore. Eventually you understand why the storylines are kept separate yet included together in the same novel. Alternating storylines might not be such a unique technique anymore, but here it truly adds to the overall thematic material and greater meaning of the story. In typical Murakami fashion, each storyline reads as very surreal and strange, combing such genres as the old detective novel, sci-fi, dystopia, and Kafkaesque exploration. The reader is always trying to figure out exactly what’s going to happen and why, and is exposed to such things as mythical creatures, super technology, but also human psychology, the meaning of unseen existence, and honest introspection. There’s definite vibes of The Matrix and Total Recall going on as the major theme of “a person’s consciousness” comes to the forefront, with analysis and dramatization of what’s real, showing the mind within the mind. As a psychology minor, I totally ate it up. And his writing is done in a very easy to read, understandable way; it’s only the greater themes that are revealed after the easily-accessible reading that leave the reader lost in thought, trying to decipher the metaphor, trying to put the puzzle pieces together."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,3,"March 31, 2015","Murakami at his best is the novelists' answer to David Lynch- a teller of tales where dreamlike surrealism is offset by more humdrum reality. This is expertly done in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and less effectively in After Dark. Here though, there is an A story and a B story, both of which are utterly bizarre. One is set in a strange Kafkaesque town of unicorns and amnesiacs (""The End of the World"") while the other tale (""Hard-Boiled Wonderland"") is ostensibly set in the real world but quickly descends into peculiar cyberpunk and subterranean monsters. Without any solid reality to cling on to, the surrealism becomes wearing."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,2,"October 24, 2016","Well, different strokes for different folks. Give it a try since there are so many out there that would just simply die without this magical Kafkaesque novel."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,3,"November 1, 2012","However, in this instance, I'm not entirely sure I'd recommend Hard-Boiled Wonderland to any first time Murakami reader, perhaps because you need to first understand the very Kafkaesque nature of his intentions. It's a fascinating book that poses a very unique and intriguing theory that the mind can be separated from the self. But I was left mostly unmoved by the characters, which I found strange because usually I love Murakami's characters."
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,3,"September 21, 2016",A book in traditional Murakami style. It starts out really interesting and gripped me right away with a surreal and somewhat Kafkaesque mystery plot. The book slows down towards the middle and left me uninterested in anything but the mystery. The story is saved by a big chunk of expositional monologue towards the last third of the book.
Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,5,"July 30, 2014",In this he drops some of his more tiresome tropes (though many Murakami clichés remain intact)&amp; goes all out for a full-on sci-fi/detective/post-modern-weird-Kafkaesque-situation-experience.

Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,4,"November 4, 2009","I am still absorbing this one, and don't really feel up to a full review, but here are my rather disjointed impressions. A strange, kafkaesque book that is still an intriguing, quick read. Enough humour that the themes of loneliness and isolation are not unbearable. The good kind of post-modern."

Portnoy s Complaint,4,"August 13, 2018","While the self-deprecation is played for laughs, at its best, Portnoy’s Complaint is a meditation on what it means to be a person torn between high minded ideals and the messier reality of what a person wants in life. Yet, while the book is as vivid and enthralling as the loquacious Portnoy expounding upon the terrible curse that is his life with Kafkaesque comedy, the story doesn’t quite escape its narrative conceit. Portnoy complains, a lot. I find myself, like Bob Newhart, wondering if just telling him to STOP would be enough to force the reconciliation of a relatively common conflict between self and social expectation. Be libertine! Be good! Be anything but the guy paralyzed between the two."
Infinite Jest,5,"May 8, 2012","This dystopian-lite world is a messed up version of our own, slightly in the future. I can't overstate what a depressing effect subsidized time has: YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT. Y.D.A.U. Order and logic replaced by Kafkaesque commercial nonsense. And, O.N.A.N.!"
Infinite Jest,5,"July 21, 2016","But now? This book is written by someone who is too good at convincing you that his view of the universe is the view of the universe, but my god! Calm the fuck down, life is brilliant! There was a snot-nosed Kafkaesque didactic nature to all the humour within- like 'this is terrible, but you must learn to laugh at this stuff, because life is terrible' and I think a younger prurient me both enjoyed the sadness of the lives within while pointlessly commending the author for even bothering to talk to such people (Sew brayve &lt;3)."
Infinite Jest,4,"May 12, 2025","- worst fear is irrationality. Life so Kafkaesque and backwards that you can’t even reason with it. Example: trapped in a therapy session. The professionals are all fake, and to get appease them you have to fake insanity and play their game"
sleep has no master,5,"January 29, 2014","I think ultimately what makes this book so fucking good is not that it clearly ripped off all of my memories and crammed them into a short story collection. It is so good because Konrath knows how to take the irritations of just being alive and turn them into something that some might call Kafkaesque, but I won’t because I fear hipsters showing up and yelling at me for being so lame as to use the term. Nevertheless, Konrath has a keen eye for the details of mundane life and how they just absolutely suck. I recall Robert Crumb saying that he tended to blank out urban blight – like how electricity poles looked and the way urban streets were laid out – and he had to take pictures of such places and objects in order to reproduce them accurately in his drawings. Such things are visually unappealing but a drawing of a city street would be incomplete without them. Konrath is intimately familiar with blight – the eternal cosmic noise and pop culture references and memes and endless, almost Tarantino-esque conversations that make up the lives of the ordinary and often completely insane modern man. He finds a pathos where other writers might find ennui. He creates humor where others might find disaffected annoyance. To make the small indignities, random events and looming horrors of this life so very funny while maintaining a genuinely absurdist edge is its own genius. Konrath is, in his own unsettling way, a weird hero."
lolita,5,"December 29, 2015","We became first acquainted, Vladimir and I, through a hardbound edition of Invitation to a Beheading I found yellow and pungent with the scent of years gone by in my college library, and reading through the Kafkaesque nightmare of Cincinnatus, that ultimate black comedy of the human condition--fighting and struggling against an unknown terror, an unnamed crime--I humbly agreed to the general opinion that Nabokov is good. A remarkable prose stylist, language is a plaything in his hands, a fistful of sand that is transformed into stardust and rosewater on the page. Lolita is perfectly worded, and that is an understatement. As an artwork, it rips you apart, dazzles you and leaves you breathless, only to rip you apart all over again as it courses through unflinchingly the mire of human duplicity, madness and obsession. The book does not condone incest, dear Reader, as it revels in it, spouts it unashamedly--it is perhaps (if we must talk of ""meaning"" at all) a parody, a satire, a farce--it ridicules and mocks rather than sympathize, for there is little pathos, little that I found at least, between the velvet of its pages. Poor Lolita, Lola, our very own Dolores Haze, you poor nymphet of broken, barren trees, is dehumanized beyond any ounce of compassion--I left her stranded and so irrevocably dead. What did it matter? Lola is all of us; there are so, so many of us that perhaps the horror is normalized--we hardly flinch anymore. And Humbert, what of cher monsieur Humbert? Is there any sympathy for the devil? There must be, in the hearts of many, there must be a few hesitant sighs and sobs. But I left him mad, so beautifully mad and alone, his claws dripping with honey and fresh blood, the soft flesh of his tongue quivering with poetry and music, mon chanteur, mon amour Humbert!"
lolita,5,"March 15, 2021","For a sizable early chunk of the novel, it seemed like a book it would be unseemly to rate too highly, best read while wearing a concerned grimace or sanctimonious frown. Nabokov’s prose is hypnotic, even when I haven’t got a clue what he’s talking about, but in any case I found the narrative more comprehensible than his Kafkaesque (yes, I know) Invitation to a Beheading, or even his somewhat cubist memoir Speak, Memory. The annotations were indispensable in helping elevate this work in my mind from uncomfortable-but-ultimately-rewarding to masterful product of a genius, illuminating the many devices, puns, clues, references, and French idioms liberally and methodically planted throughout."
lolita,3,"December 13, 2023","The story and writing tries to fool you into siding with a pedophile, and they do so very well. It's a weird experience. The ending felt almost kafkaesque to me. Sounds great? Well, yeah. It still draaaaaagged a lot for me. The characters have little agenda, so it's more a book of concept than a book of plot. And I tend to like to have both combined. Still, one of the more interesting classics I read - oh, and it's very readable, too!"
lolita,5,"April 10, 2017","I am not going to delve into the novel's summary but rather how I felt by the sheer greatness of the writer. The novel is written in the first person narrative and the storyteller is a cruel unreliable narrator and he speaks in truth of his manners and intentions all throughout the story but what is most commendable is the style in which it is done. I feel that the manner and style is very similar to J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Mark Twain's Huck Finn but in no way is the content the same. The novel has a lot of anagrams, neologism, double entendres(double meanings), play of words and phrases, puns and the vernacular. The reader will forever wonder if Lolita's motives are true coz' we can only listen through the words of psychologically ill person and how it comes through to us is mostly hit or miss if we are not ready for justifiable interpretation. Part 1 is mostly erotic in motif but the second part opens up with social commentary and metaphors but keeping in mind that we are still inside the mind of helpless individual who can't get out of his predicament. I had strange Kafkaesque feeling while reading this book and even at that it is truly a page-turner."
down the drain,5,"February 15, 2024","A modern classic, truly Kafkaesque"
boundless,4,"May 8, 2018","I want to thank Drawn &amp; Quarterly for sending me a copy of this. I have to admit I was entirely unfamiliar with Jillian Tamaki going into it, but I love love love her illustration work here. I’m also a big fan of the way that the narration jumps around sometimes “documentary style” in these stories. Most of them are slice-of-life focused, kafkaesque, or modern fantasy, which are all genres I think graphic novels are particularly well-suited for. I’ve written about this previously in reviews of other comic/graphic stories, and it’s still rings true here."
boundless,5,"January 5, 2018","To fans of Black Mirror, Jillian Tamaki's new graphic novel Boundless provides an earnest, but less foreboding, look at the ways in which technology and modern living can go awry. In each story, This One Summer co-author Tamaki draws from all-too-real anxieties about life in the social media age, mashing them up with a Kafkaesque sense of magical realism that leaves the reader feeling refreshed, instead of weighed down.That's not to say that Boundless is not a weighty book. Between its covers are a world in which profiles on a Facebook clone site take on lives of their own, a woman's size reduction alienates her from the rest of society, and the residents of one city suddenly find that they can communicate with animals. Behind each of these stories is a message, or perhaps multiple messages, designed to provoke a deeper level of thought on the utter oddity of our everyday lives. However, unlike Black Mirror, which has become popular for much the same reason, Boundless and its moral lessons each contain a glimmer of hope for the future.For those readers who believe that graphic novels are all superhero beat-em-ups, Boundless may serve as a broadening of horizons. Tamaki tells a handful of complete, cohesive stories in this admittedly bulky tome, and although all of her tales share the central theme of social anxiety, they venture far from the sort of ""traditional"" graphic novel fare that restricts itself to a single narrative. That fact alone makes Boundless the perfect graphic novel for both newbies to the genre and hardcore fans looking for something a little bit different.
  I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for this review."
Notes from Underground,4,"September 27, 2013","A tense, angsty early Dostoevsky novel, written as the ramblings of an unhappy outcast. The first half rings a absurdist - almost discordian - note, questioning the value of knowledge and accepted truths. The second half tells a few fragmented stories from the protagonist's life, illustrating his Kafkaesque self-loathing and his failed attempts to connect to a women of low social standing (a theme revisited in Crime and Punishment's Sonia)."
Notes from Underground,4,"June 19, 2023","This was a magnificent analysis of the uglier contours of human nature and an eerily modern, almost proto-Kafkaesque commentary on the alienating, embittering impact of the increasingly depersonalised, detached and, at times, absurd ways in which we move through society."
Notes from Underground,5,"January 12, 2021",The underground man is a character more Kafkaesque than even Kafka's characters.
Pornografia,4,"December 25, 2019","Despite the title, Witold Gombrowicz’s novel, “Pornografia” is not about what is typically considered pornography. The term is only used once, and interestingly, more in line with an eye witness voyeurism and engineering of generational conflict. The Polish-born author lived most of his life in exile in Argentina during and after WWII. However the story’s setting is a rural Polish village during the wartime year 1943. Characters include two older gentlemen from Warsaw, one of which bears the author’s name. Older adults stand in contrast to younger adolescents from the village. Indeed, Gombrowicz’s youths can be characterized as Nietzsche superstars (there is a not-so-subtle erotic-homoerotic subcurrent), while older characters represent maturity and waning masculinity. Besides exploring the relationship between young and old, male and female, Gombrowicz pits atheism against theism. He also touches on the bounds of cruelty and loyalty (""God, art, nation, proletariat""). These investigations subtend a riveting story line involving murder and the Polish Underground. In summary, the author-narrator describes his task to be a “humorist, a joker, an acrobat, a provocateur . . . My works turn double somersaults to please. I am a circus, lyricism, poetry, horror, riots, games – what more do you want?” I think Gombrowicz needs to add philosopher to the list, otherwise this Kafkaesque novel certainly succeeded in meeting Gombrowicz's objectives. And I sincerely doubt there is anything more that the reader could ask from a story."
The Library of Babel,3,"May 13, 2022","I have to admit, the ten-page-long story was a challenge to read. I had to read two versions translated into English and another into my native Arabic. The used diction is detached and dry and a bit scholarly. Perhaps, it was precisely chosen to reflect the dominating atmosphere in the librarians' world, which is the complete opposite of paradise, a kind of Kafkaesque air that permeates the chambers, depressing and smothering."
Life As We Knew It,3,"September 5, 2015","Sometimes you need to read a Kafkaesque book just so you're reminded that no matter how bad you think you have it, it can always be worse...so appreciate what you have."
mcglue,5,"June 3, 2023",The Hangover but make it kafkaesque
Phenomenology of Spirit,5,"November 29, 2020","Progress is never linear, as societies and communities will overcompensate to what is perceived as wrong takes. This is inescapable and will happen with every issue from every topic. Morals and ethics are dancing drunk on top of bamboo forests. Fortunately, insights are unforgiving - fractals hidden on every manifold and forever expanding - and can be taken from everywhere (think of Art). This makes Hegel an over-optimist, as he is blind to asymptotic escape velocity when it comes to framing improvement (e.g. his view on institutions). A kafkaesque take would be more honest: bureaucratic nightmares continuously prove, over and over again, to be able to grow faster than good intentions."
Les Mis rables,4,"January 24, 2021","Enter Inspector Javert, Hugo's embodiment not of Good but of Order. Javert's commitment to law and authority is tautological - it must be obeyed because it is law and authority - and he takes visible pleasure in subjecting others to the law's severity. At first suspecting the beloved Mayor Madeleine of being the convict Valjean, he later recants his theory as some poor dolt in a neighboring town is arrested for stealing apples and roundly accused of being the infamous Valjean. Real name Champmathieu, he is subjected to a Kafkaesque trial in which his insistence upon his true identity is proof of his guilt."
the meowmorphosis,3,"February 29, 2012","I think this would be an excellent way to introduce someone to Kafka’s work, and since you can hardly find a book that isn’t described as “Kafkaesque” these days, it might be a good way start, as the majority of it stays very close to Kafka's telling. The illustrations are a fun addition as well...who doesn't love a cat?"
the meowmorphosis,Not rated,"May 23, 2011","The appendix contains an amusing poke at Kafka’s life and a funny section of Discussion Questions. The photo collage illustrations, created by Matthew Richardson, are gorgeous and haunting, humorously mocking surrealism and adding a key element to the work overall. This book falls squarely in the genre of Humor. There is no gore, and very little threatening plot or suspense. The horror of the novel is Kafkaesque, that is, within the mind of the reader."
the meowmorphosis,3,"May 4, 2012","It was a bit of a vague book, though not bad. Part of the problem is that I never read Kafka's Metamorphosis, so I cannot compare it to the original and probably did not get some injokes. It is nevertheless a nice read, not too hard, with long sentences and a sad ending - but that's exactly what is Kafkaesque about it, I guess :P"
the meowmorphosis,2,"May 19, 2013","I loved the idea of the novel. I was really excited to read the parody of Kafka's original work. However, there were times of stream of consciousness, that I felt were trying too hard to be Kafkaesque. The effort was lacking."
Hunger,5,"October 31, 2022","And the Kafkaesque (or rather, PRE-Kafkaesque) …"
Hunger,4,"February 28, 2025","Hunger is my first Hamsun novel maybe even the first Norwegian author. I may have read Ibsen way back when, I can't remember, and Fosse's Septology is on my TBR, but rest is all blurry. So is Hunger. On the surface it is ramblings of a starving writer -with no plot- focusing on the inner feelings and thoughts of the protagonist. His physical and psychological alienation, his existential anxiety gives a Kafkaesque sense, or of Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground, like other reviews have pointed out. Hamsun had masterfully depicted destitute, how anyone can get delusional and easily lose decency. Not sure whether it was the recognition, or he got rich later, but Hamsun seems to have lost his way in his late life. Wish he kept his sensitivity as described in here: “The intelligent poor individual was a much finer observer than the intelligent rich one. The poor individual looks around him at every step, listens suspiciously to every word he hears from the people he meets; thus, every step he takes presents a problem, a task, for his thoughts and feelings. He is alert and sensitive, he is experienced, his soul has been burned...”"
Hunger,3,"March 9, 2022",a kafkaesque take on crime and punishment but it’s just struggling artist tings. i can see how this is boring to some but i thought it was fine.
Hunger,5,"May 18, 2021","Kafkaesque absurdity, a sign that Hamsun has anticipated 20th century writing with a"
Hunger,3,"May 21, 2016","Note: I think that different translations can emphasize different aspects of the story. From what I understand, Bly’s translation makes of the protagonist a ground-down victim in a naturalistic story, while earlier translations bowdlerized and removed the sexual element (both with Ylayali and the landlady’s dalliance). In these instances, I suspect that the humor is lost or so tamped down that it fails to register. I read what is considered the most authoritative translation, done in 1996 by Sverre Lyngstad, and it does convey with a Kafkaesque touch the queer humor of a frustrated protagonist further frustrating himself."
Hunger,4,"January 13, 2021",Very intense exploration of a man in dire straights who is experiencing extreme episodes of hunger but in most instances maintains his pride and attempts to maintain his integrity. Very reminiscent of Dostoevsky's work and as others have stated with Kafkaesque themes.
War and Peace,2,"September 22, 2017","I'd avoided reading War and Peace for a while because the only Russian literature I'd read was Kafka, and I assumed W&amp;P would be 1000+ pages of something Kafkaesque. Then I listened to the audiobook version of Anna Karenina, realized that was pretty much just a big soap opera - long, but not dense - and figured it was time to climb the mountain. It was time to read War and Peace (read, not listen, just so no reading purist can say it doesn't count.) I can honestly say I'm happy to have finished this, but boy did I not enjoy it."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"June 15, 2025","The book is organized in an unique manner, in a way that it consists of stories that are connected through common themes and characters so much so that some of the characters defy the ordeal of death and spring back to life again. The father of the narrator is one of the common threads which weave trails of magic across the stories, his name- Jacob- gives the impressions of some biblical influences. Jacob keeps on struggling on the tricky rift of being and nothingness as he gets progressively diminished from the realms of life, so that his family members become steadily ignorant of his existence, but springs back to existence from the unfathomable and limitless, unbound depths of nothingness, in some of the stories. His existence becomes so trivial and an element of farce humor that his family could not distinguish between him and cockroaches, reminds me inevitably of Kafka, as the world of Schultz seems to possess the typical eerie and dark elements of Kafkaesque world."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"January 5, 2019","Schulz is sometimes compared to Kafka, but he should not be. He is not Kafkaesque. The world of Kafka is a nightmare world ~ a nightmare from which one cannot awaken. The world of Schulz is the real world touched by the fantastic, the real world as perceived in a dream. Nor is this magical realism, for elements of fantasy do not truly invade the real world. It is only the narrator’s perceptions which import the fantastic or the grotesque into the real."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"December 30, 2014","The building is almost human, while Jacob has almost become part of the furniture. The concept of this metamorphosis might sound Kafkaesque, but its design and application is unique to Schulz."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"December 25, 2014","The Street of Crocodiles is a semi-autobiographical sketch of Schulz's life in Drohobych, Poland. It is a post-modernist fragmented novel with a distinguishable but structureless plot. When Schulz was 44 years old, he helped his fiancee in translating Franz Kafka's opus, The Trial (3 stars). This book was first published as The Cinnamon Shops in 1934, 9 years after The Trial was first published. Obviously, Kafka was one of the major influences in Schulz writing and it is apparent in this book by having the kafkaesque elements of bizarre, meaningless, hopelessness meaning no-escape situations."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"July 20, 2014","Schultz was sadly cut down in his prime, a shy and sweet writer who had a Kafkaesque way of seeing absurdity in the world, but an infinitely brighter disposition. His childlike intensity and erudition are matched with an artist's eye. With these tools he created surreally beautiful and unique literary structures which, even when not totally cohering, stand far apart from any of his contemporaries. We can only wonder what he would have made of the disillusionment of the post-holocaust world, that inspired such wholly different artistic endeavours."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"September 16, 2007","A relatively unknown work of genius from Eastern Europe. Too bad the Nazis ended his literary career early, otherwise, some critic might have coined the term ""Schulzian"" rather than ""Kafkaesque."" Better than Kafka at times. Where Kafka wrote out of angst and fear, Schulz wrote from the nostalgic desires of the heart. Sad and haunting, funny and poignant. One of my favorite books."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"February 21, 2023","Kafkaesque, wildly inventive, almost psychedelic."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"August 8, 2019","The Street of Crocodiles is a sort of autobiography in the form of short related episodes that are gradually transformed from bright surreal to darker Kafkaesque shades. Schultz studied and taught art and you can feel this in his colorful visual writing and the weird, yet unique, imagery he uses. The best part of the book is an episode called ""cinnamon shops."" Enough to say that this is, for me, the literary equivalent to Van Gogh's Starry Night!"
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"November 3, 2010","Kafkaesque in a way that Kafka should have been, this selection of short stories - actually more like a series of portraits - reveal an ordinary world where not much happens, but yet, paradoxically, everything happens. Flanked by the tragicomic figure of the father, a man whose genius/madness is only matched by his idiosyncratic choices of study, the narrator (Schulz himself...as a boy growing up) is content to draw out the rich descriptions and events."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"June 1, 2008","This story is told from the point of view of a young boy growing up in a small Polish town just as modernization is taking hold and crass commercialism/Americanism is beginning to change the way people live. There are a lot of fantastical weather and nature-related events that take place, creating images that will stay with you. It's also supposedly Kafkaesque, but I've never read Kafka, so I can't say. I learned about this book from an Israeli artist who I was talking to at a gallery in Bushwick, she had crafted miniature, warped townscapes set into dresser drawers; all inspired by this book."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"July 10, 2025","Schulz’s father—a central and recurring figure—is a failed merchant, a bird-breeder, a prophet, a madman, a shaman, a Kafkaesque patriarch whose identity mutates as frequently as Schulz’s sentences do. In one story, he becomes obsessed with breeding mythical birds, claiming that birds represent the lost poetry of the universe."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"June 16, 2020","Anyway, once the shining light of its influence wears off, the book personally didn't reach the same soaring heights as, say, ""The Library of Babel"" or One Hundred Years of Solitude, but it does stand up as an important part of the magical realist and postmodernist canons. The stories of flocks of birds, wild pagan rituals, bizarre science experiements, kafkaesque (Schulz was absolute indebted to Kafka) cockroach-transformations, and so much more are fascinating and written in a very flowery prose-poetry style that miiiiiight come across as over-the-top to some (I was kinda rolling my eyes at a few passages, but as I read it in translation maybe it's not as bad in Polish), but when a moment lands, it REALLY lands. All in all: a short little work I'm glad I read."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"August 26, 2023","This book, independently, would have been a lower score because I struggled to read it without the guidance of the class I was reading it with. After the professor explained the book I realized that while it wasn’t my preferred example of the uncanny, magical realizing, surrealism, and the Kafkaesque (I much preferred actual Kafka whose stories are more dark and disconcerting than whimsical and dreamlike)… it wasn’t a bad book or a bad example of these sorts of themes and forms."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"July 13, 2025","This is a collection of flowery surreal stories that are abstract, obtuse, and Kafkaesque."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"May 7, 2023",Actually Kafkaesque.
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"August 29, 2007","different from what i expected, which i guess was some kind of collection of kafkaesque stories. instead a very concentrated poetic language. a portrait of a father as dreamer and house-prisoner. nothing happens, more so than kafka, and the proust comparison on the cover is maybe more apt. the description of seasons and his varieties of sunlight are very beautiful."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"February 2, 2013","This was one of those books that I think went over my head. The prose is some of the most dizzyingly complex and beautiful I've seen and it's bursting with images that'll make your jaw drop... but it just didn't click for me. Too confusing, too weird and embarassing. I recommend it though, particularly for people into magical realism or things that are Kafkaesque. I have no doubt that this is probably one of the top 3 books in that genre. Will definitely re-read someday and hopefully appreciate more fully."
The Street of Crocodiles,3,"October 21, 2012","Not that it's not good. But it just doesn't come in the right time. I could only finished half of it. But surely will be back to it again later. While my readings recently evolves around Big questions the Marxists in the 50s asked, this book appears to be self-obsessive. I'm sure Schulz knew what the big questions are about. He's a victim of it himself. The Kafkaesque language couldn't carry me away this time. Well, it's like having a cold meat on a hot day."
The Street of Crocodiles,5,"June 3, 2015","Lesser known than Kafka; more poetic than Kafka; in a word, Kafkaesque, w/o the faceless bureaucratic stuff. Filmic. Reminded me of watching a David Lynch film. Language was extraordinary, and the beauty of the prose offered a tragic contrast to the mental deterioration of the narrator's father. Highly recommended."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"December 28, 2011","Surrealist, obsessive description of minutia and the inner-workings of objects in a Kafkaesque dreamscape. Lovely."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"August 6, 2013","Encounters with modernity at times Proustian, at times Kafkaesque, even sometimes reminiscent of the eery and fun beginning of Against the Day. Yet entirely original, weird, and lovely."
The Street of Crocodiles,4,"February 26, 2015","Beautifully creepy and terrifying, I can't help but feel it's dumb luck that the world chose to bring Kafkaesque into vernacular while Schulz remains known only in weirdo literary circles."
the great gatsby,5,"December 31, 2011","I read my high school copy - just about every one of its brittle, yellowing pages marked up; each colour and number circled, as though Fitzgerald's ham-fisted symbolism was the most important thing. I certainly remembered the novel most vividly for all its golds and pinks and whites and 12s and flowers and ashes, and of course for the lassitudinous debauchery; that feeling that can only be described as ""Gatsbyesque"" with the full range of connotation that describing something as Kafkaesque has."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 14, 2024","In a simple and accessible language, with a good touch of irony, this story opens several doors of reflection on Kafkaesque themes such as dependence, work, a ruthless world, social relationships, family, and the meaning of life."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 19, 2017","""Maybe it's not so bad to live here and now after all"", he said, smiling in a truly Kafkaesque way."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 27, 2018","I read it in high school, and loved it. I read it again and loved it more. There's not a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings in a Kafkaesque universe; they can be cold, confusing, honest... real. But with a touch of humor that prevents you from wanting to jump off your balcony."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 5, 2012",It's totally kafkaesque (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpAVa6...)
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 3, 2010","There is no doubt that Kafka was/is a genious. Reading his work made me really see why he died so young; great thinkings suffer from their thoughts, and torture themselves to deal with all the ideas pushing forward to be heard first. I will agree with one thing though, there is no defining the Kafkaesque, for it, like beauty, comes in many forms."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 2, 2018","I didn’t want to like Kafka. When I first heard of him, I classified him as one of those writers people like so they can have some self-validation about their intelligence, like an association with college professors of something. I decided to try Kafka after a Breaking Bad episode entitled “Kafkaesque.” A humorous moment in the episode shows one of the main characters, a recovering meth addict and dealer, talking in a street-slang vernacular and saying something to his partner like, “You wouldn’t get it. It’s Kafkaesque, man!” I interpreted Kafka as a dark writer."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 13, 2016","As I turned the last leaf of this novella by kafka, my mind plunged into a state of disoriented multiplicity of rumination. Something unsettling, something insoluble wandered aimlessly in my troubled mind, making it turbid. I frowned in thought, as if to clarify this morbid state of turbidity through the purging effect of concentration. I slowly started to deconstruct this disconcerting turbidity by trying to pull the reins of my mind firmly. The world according to Kafka is absurd indeed- nothing matters life or world. The often used term ‘Kafkaesque’ is thus self-explanatory: something that is senselessly, preposterously complicated. If thought in a broader and unbridled perspective, what is more complicated than life itself, which is a totality or embodiment of all complications, if only complications are taken into consideration? And knowing its senseless complications, what is more absurd than life? Kafka spins your head but not his novella. The novella is simple, but if you go deeper into decoding the symbolisms- beware."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 24, 2023","No leía La metamorfosis desde que era un adolescente. En ese entonces, no conseguí empatizar con el argumento tanto como ahora. Creo que crecer en el capitalismo tardío te vuelve más kafkaesque. También supongo que leer un libro para el colegio siempre merma la experiencia estética. Ese fue un comentario que se repitió harto durante el taller. Más allá de su instalación en el canon literario, entiendo porqué la obra de Kafka está tan vigente para la juventud: todavía nos aqueja la ansiedad por un futuro sin esperanzas. En esta lectura, me llamaron muchísimo la atención las dinámicas familiares. La responsabilidad del hijo para con sus padres, por ejemplo. La traducción de Borges estuvo entretenida - me gustó mucho que dijera ""patitas"" - y se me hizo fácil de leer."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 30, 2022","If you ever wondered what Kafkaesque means, read this short description of a confused man's lonely decline while his family hides their freak. Truly the Granddaddy of Weird."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 24, 2024","What is the meaning of Kafkaesque? Well, you can begin to unravel it here, in Kafka’s most accessible and popular (?) tale. You wake up prepared to head out to your soul-killing, joyless job that you dutifully go to day in and day out only in order to support your ungrateful and lethargic family, but find that you’ve been transformed into some kind of giant cockroach or dung beetle and are unable to roll off your back out of bed. How do you react? What thought process is running through your mind about this extraordinary event? Why, of course, you react by worrying that you will miss your train into work and fret about how your demanding, unforgiving boss will react to your being late. You can now proceed to The Trial and The Castle for advanced Kafkaesque studies."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 28, 2015","What a bizarre, frightening, delightful work. I have heard the term ""Kafkaesque” and spotted allusions to this text all my life, only to venture forth with reading it now. One hour well spent tracing the change, or the lack of one in Gregor Samsa as he negotiates the divide between body and identity."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 13, 2025",This was so Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2020","Dù với hai tính chất đã nêu trên, tôi thấy cuốn vẫn khai thác một đề tài rất... Kafkaesque. Bắt đầu bằng một hoàn cảnh phi lý - cuối cùng dẫn tới nhận thức nào đó về thế giới. Nó đem lại cảm giác của một câu chuyện châm biếm, nhưng bởi câu chuyện do Kafka kể nên là châm biếm không có tiếng cười."
The Metamorphosis,2,"April 20, 2018",Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 7, 2022","This is one of his top three works, one of the longest pieces he actually finished. If his awful-sounding life had been less egregious, would his works be as haunting? Would he have written with greater clarity and hope? In large part, the absence of hope operates throughout his gloomy oeuvre. His life, like his books, were Kafkaesque in a sense. He embodied the principles he satirized. His protagonists are inextricable from one another. The world building runs through all of his stories, diaries and novels."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 20, 2025","Ah, The Metamorphosis—known for its Kafkaesque despair and giant insect vibes. Not to be confused with the California Metamorphosis, with bouquet more akin to a butterfly garden, kombucha, and a wellness retreat. However, this literary metamorphosis offers no such comforts. Instead, it’s a masterclass in tragic absurdity and familial dysfunction."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 3, 2022","You know you've made it when a word is created to describe your writing (Kafkaesque: having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality). Because of the many references to Franz Kafka I was interested in reading something by him, but knew that it was most probably not going to be my type of book. Once again, audible came to the rescue with their free version narrated by Ralph Cosham."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 1, 2021","How very ""kafkaesque” of him!!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 10, 2018","A Message from the Emperor - 3/5 - There is an interesting piece in the Atlantic Monthly that describes how this very short parable can be used to define the term ""Kafkaesque"" (read it here: https://www.theatlantic.com/entertain...). The parable itself is also contained within the short story The Great Wall of China which is not included in this collection."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 4, 2018","Great Philosophy writers of 20th century - Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Gabriel Garcia Marquez were influenced by this book and other Kafkaesque works. They studied these as textbooks."
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 10, 2023","one does not simply talk about Kafka, but instead stand in awe of all things Kafkaesque. in this piece of surrealist and absurdist literature, through the increasing dichotomy between Gregor's mind and body, Kafka delves into themes of alienation and dehumanisation, we how as nuclear families and employment are all oppressive enslaving structures. it is bleak and it is existential, but it is unsettling resonant and incredibly poignant."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 5, 2025","A fascinating layer of The Metamorphosis is its autobiographical undertones. Kafka’s own life was marked by a sense of alienation. His complex relationship with his authoritarian father, Hermann Kafka, profoundly influenced his writing. He was an outsider from the start, grappling with authority, self-blame, and a deep sense of inadequacy. It’s ironic, and tragic, that a writer so profoundly insightful was never truly recognized in his lifetime. Why does this happen to the greatest writers? Did you know that, due to this, Kafka had even asked his friend Max Brod to burn his manuscripts after his death? Thankfully, Brod ignored him, allowing the world to witness Kafka’s genius. Today, the word Kafkaesque is used to describe senseless, nightmarish situations—something The Metamorphosis embodies perfectly."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 16, 2015","My first encounter with the works of Franz Kafka, a writer that has its own adjective, Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 17, 2020","I’ve periodically heard various things referred to as Kafkaesque and inferred from context that it was never a good thing. Having never read any of Franz Kafka’s works, I figured I would see what the deal was for myself by reading through one of his most famous book The Metamorphosis. The story itself is pretty short and straightforward. Gregor Samsa, a salesman providing for his parents and sister, finds himself transformed into a giant bug and is subsequently neglected/rejected by his family and employer, leading to his untimely death. The End. As a story, it is simply awful. No redeeming qualities whatsoever."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 22, 2021","Even if the book felt a bit too dry or bizarre sometimes, I still think that the idea and execution of it was incredibly cleverly done by Kafka. I can completely understand why people have come up with the term kafkaesque to explain the absurd brilliance of his writing."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 5, 2016","I finally understand what Kafkaesque means after reading this novella (and with a little help from my friend The Internet). This was a crisp, interesting, thought-provoking read that is like a twisted take on a fable."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 31, 2021","الكتاب يصلح لتحاليل كتير, وده شيء شائع وطبيعي في أسلوب كافكا (Kafkaesque), حابب تميل للتأويل النفسي والسايكوآناليسيس للشخصيات مش هتلاقي مشكلة؛ حابب تفكر فيها كتحول حرفي وتعمل أي إسقاطات على التحول ده أو تسمحله يثير أسئلة زي ""ازاي مر على جريجور سامسا التحول كفكرة عابرة مش المفروض نقف عندها كتير؟ ازاي كل اللي كان همه إنه ميخيبش آمال اللي حواليه وإنه ميتأخرش عن شغله رغم إنمساخه لإنه مضطر يوفر حاجات لناس تانية لدرجة إن إنمساحه ده مجرد شيء ثانوي له"" مش هتلاقي برضو مشكلة."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 29, 2023",I never thought I would relate so much to a bug. This book makes me feel so much better about rotting away in my bedroom because at least I’m doing it in a kafkaesque way.
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 9, 2024","I was curious to learn what kind of stories lead to a word like ‘kafkaesque’, so I finally read ‘The Metamorphosis’, or rather, listened to an excellent audiobook version narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, and I was far more moved and engaged by it than I expected. I found the acute mixture of humour and tragedy fascinating, along with the way it was all delivered through the main protagonist Gregor Samsa’s very matter-of-fact narration of his unusual predicament – namely having been suddenly transformed into a giant insect."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 17, 2014","Mrs. Samsa was fed up. Her husband a hateful bigot and misogynist, not to mention a sexmaniac. He daughter a frail and febrile young idiot, always crying and sweeping like a dolt. And now her son! A goddamn beetle! What the hell would she do with a beetle for a son? God, had her womb failed her. While her disgusting family was distracted by the immense Ungeziefer-ness of Gregor, she slipped away into the cold morning air. She took a deep breath and pulled her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders, and gave a huff of visible freedom in the cold air. Walking away, passing under her abandoned window, she heard a crash, and stepping quickly out of the way, she saw her son, fallen and smashed on the sidewalk, like Icarus. ""Complete idiot"" she thought to herself, ""my son, born this fine, fucking morning with a set of beetley-wings to get up and fly away with, and the complete idiot fails even to open them up when he jumps from the fifth story! Botches the whole damn getaway. A real idiot. Real idiots, the whole lot of them!"" She continued walking, and as her steps trailed away from that place in the cold and stuff mud of that morning, the traces of somewhat wrinkly smile began to crack onto her not-yet-old face. She was still a bit beautiful, she thought to herself, and she wasn't yet old. She was getting away from that disastrous family, that besmirching episode on her life. Those two children which she could not find the motherly tenderness to love for their disgusting faults and transformations, and her husband who she thought had nothing but semen and stale beer coursing through his veins. ""To hell with them all!"" she said in a loud whisper as she turned the corner. Later that day, meeting a girlfriend in a coffee shop, two towns away (she was a fast walker, but quickly tired), she retold the story of her morning, and her friend offered to pay the bill for the woman's black coffee. ""The whole thing, you know, so strange. I'd even go ahead and call it Kafkaesque, it was so damned odd. Y'know?"" Her friend looked her straight in the eye, with a look that turned imperceptibly from compassion to disdain, from the warmth of friendship to the coldness of a critic, ""Really, ""Kafkaesque""? Why's that? Was it needlessly bureaucratic? Was it hopelessly complex? Really, Gitta, you know that damned expression is overused by idiots!"" And she got up and left."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 19, 2023",After reading the book over 11 times and doing a going through a lots of philosophies I have finally decided time write a review for the most famous Kafkaesque..
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 28, 2018","All in all, if you enjoy disappearing into strange, unnatural, dream like worlds, then you will appreciate the storytelling ideas of Kafka. I know he was deeply political, and his stories have philosophical meanings; but this one I am going to remember for its bizarre, nightmarish plot that came straight from the equally bizarre mind of Kafka. After all, you don't get your last name turned into a synonym for deeply disturbed alienation unless you write something pretty disturbing, and The Metamorphosis is considered to be about as Kafkaesque as Kafka gets."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 11, 2018","“the blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""kafkaesque”"
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 22, 2019","I didn't question why, how and what is happening. I just jumped on this wild wacky ride and enjoyed it to the end. I now know what 'Kafkaesque' means, and it's nothing you'd want to experience in your worst nightmares."
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 9, 2020","I don't remember actually enjoying this work, and consider Kafka's The Castle superior in the lingering impressions that play in one's mind. From the latter, I still use the word Kafkaesque where applicable ;-)"
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 11, 2024","It's gross when he turns into the bug, but I love how matter-of-fact everything is. It's very Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 2, 2023","Actually, the cockroach infestation in my apartment isn't ""gross"" or ""a health hazard"", it's ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 28, 2019","Metamorphosis is a classic for a reason. I think it is one of the major cause or contributor of 'Kafkaesque' term, which means oppressive and nightmarish."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 8, 2023",so kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 3, 2024",P/s: Chắc các bạn cũng không lạ với cái dòng văn phi lý này với thuật ngữ “Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 4, 2017","The Metomorphosis is a brilliant short story about the absurdity of life, and is, without doubt, Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 18, 2020","kafkaesque indeed....His stories are like weird dreams you get during afternoon sleeps or when you wake up early in the morning stay awake for an hour and go back to sleep again. Vivid dream like, logic less yet very personal. Oddly I can hear his soul’s silent scream and his alienation via his stories."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 26, 2021","The depression was worth the ability to use 'Kafkaesque' in a sentence. Also, phenomenal book."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 27, 2025","There were a lot of stories in here that I really disliked and yeah, if I wrote them I would want to burn my manuscripts, too! But the good stories certainly outweighed the bad, with Kafka's writing reaching its peaks with  A Hunger Artist ,  In the Penal Colony ,  The Stoker: A Fragment ,  The Metamorphosis , and the three-page story that ended the short story collection,  Before the Law . I have so much to say about all of these stories, but to summarize, they were all insanely absurd, grotesque and equally depressing -- the term ""Kafkaesque"" is really the only way to adequately describe them."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 21, 2024",gregor samsa is just me when the 4 month seasonal depression hits. it doesn’t get more kafkaesque than this

The Metamorphosis,3,"December 24, 2021",I’ve had this on my tbr for a while so that I could move on to Haruki Murakami’s “Kafka on the Shore” and I do have to admit that I’ve wanted to be able to use the word Kafkaesque in a sentence or say “Pure Kafka!”
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 2, 2022","Comical, peculiar, lonesome, miserable. Truly Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 16, 2025","I ventured into the Kafkaesque world with The Metamorphosis, and as I finished the last page, I longed for more! The reader lives through the emotions of Gregor Samsa, who turns into a huge insect overnight. Kafkaesque, I now understand, is about experiencing a particular feeling that Kafka wants us to sense- and he conveys it through his metaphors. In this case, it's Samsa turning into a giant insect."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 21, 2022","was pretty lost, honestly i think im still lost. but i guess thats what makes it kafkaesque"
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 8, 2024",Hard to review. I sort of despise ‘Kafkaesque’ despite centring my recent reading around Kafka/metamorphosing. So it was nice to return to the original which is distinctly and weirdly NOT Kafkaesque. I’d not really realised how dry and witty Kafka is. In a way Metamorphosis becomes quite funny sometimes. One to keep coming back to.
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 6, 2024",recently watched a24’s a different man and felt like the film was kafkaesque in a way? thought id return to the metamorphosis and give it more thought ….
The Metamorphosis,2,"November 18, 2024",I purchased this book to find out what Kafkaesque actually means and why the Czech Republic decided to immortalize the author’s head into a kinetic sculpture in their capital city. This is what I’ve discovered:

The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"March 12, 2022","also, if i come across the word kafkaesque, i can act like i know what it means, maybe even use it as an instagram caption, the possibilities are endless ig"
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 22, 2024","as I just read this novel in one sitting, throughout the entire reading experience I had several theories and general thoughts arise.. firstly it is such an odd story and a great overview of the ""kafkaesque"" concept itself, which I think anyone who wants to get into the author's books should get familiar with. secondly, it's a commentary on capitalism as is the trial. you wake up as a bug and your first concern is getting to work, which pretty much sums up kafka's humor and irony. finally, I could not stand gregor's parents!!!!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 19, 2022","All this seems un-Kafkaesque because we need to learn to have some reverence for literary ambiguity. If anything, Kafka’s horror is facticity, which he could not overcome.&nbsp;"
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 29, 2020",I feel this book is not for everyone but is a must-read classic. If you don't get affected by deep and sad situations or can brush off absurdity and anger then you can read this too. It is the most 'OUT OF THE BOX' kind of book I have ever read. And I am so delighted that finally I know what does 'KAFKAESQUE' mean and feel like.
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 9, 2021","Infact what worries him more is being late for work; financial constraints looms large over the family. Estranged from realities — A Kafkaesque bureaucracy — forms an essential dialogue within the novella. A broken framework that has no personal stake in doing anything except for existing, cyclical in its inabilities. All of this reminded me of our struggle to breathe today. Human lives worth nothing more than a click on the EVM."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 17, 2017","Kafkaesque world is highly dangerous for all human kind. I request all people who are inside or on the way to those horrifying alleys and lethal households to stay back unless you want to find yourself eternally wounded, confused and unhinged during the reading or even after."
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 11, 2021","My first read of Kafkaesque. A nightmarish and bone-chilling tale. I like the way Franz Kafka brought the magic of another dimension, because this book is something else. The after-affect of this story is like reaction to innocent fluffy teddy bear who is being shred to threads through a large classic kitchen knife. Franz Kafka made my day 😎"
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 3, 2017","This story has been weighing heavily in the back of my mind, like a gigantic cockroach, ever since I read it. There is undeniably a specific feeling and atmosphere attached to Kafka's writing, the unique kafkaesque quality. The book was surreal, dark and heart wrenching and I absolutely loved it. It's the opposite of satisfying, it's unstable and chaotic but the meaning behind it is so profound that you're bound to remember it years after you've read it. I personally felt an existentialist dimension to it, so I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sartre or Camus."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 4, 2018","I seem to have had the opposite experience compared to most people — I liked this significantly less than I expected to. I liked the shortest stories, which were lyrical and bizarre and under five pages. I was horrified by In the Penal Colony, but it wasn't really that interesting. I was initially hooked by The Stoker, but it lost me three quarters of the way through. I was relatively unimpressed by The Metamorphosis — Kafka is saying something, but it's not that novel. It might be a little bit of the Seinfeld effect with other Kafkaesque works."
The Metamorphosis,3,"June 13, 2017",I'm reading this pretty much to find out what the word Kafkaesque means.
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 9, 2015","A powerful metaphor of how life has to move on, no matter who you lose and how. Dare I say, kafkaesque?"
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 2, 2017",Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 27, 2023",kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 6, 2023","Đọc lần thứ hai, vẫn 5 sao nhưng vì những lí do khác. Cuốn này có vẻ là tác phẩm ít chất Kafkaesque nhất của Kafka? Sẽ đọc thêm một lần nữa bản tiếng Anh trong vài năm nữa."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"August 18, 2021","Kafka invited me into this world of his creation. As one who is open to these types of invitations, I was ready to accept Kafka’s world on its face and eagerly waited to be introduced to his characters and their travails. For some reason, the story as a whole didn’t strike me as that odd, certainly not “Kafkaesque.”"
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 4, 2021","After a thorough couple of months discussing the novella and interpreting various other works of Kafka, I honestly have even more questions. After seeing glimpses into Kafka’s life through various letters he wrote, his struggle with severe depression and social anxiety is clear. It is interesting to think about how the limitations of his motivation, productivity, and confidence in his work might have affected his writing. The Metamorphosis relates to and in some aspects mirrors the struggles which he faced in his life. This makes his writing even more vulnerable and thought provoking in my opinion; it was one of Kafka’s only escapes from his life. The overall theme/vibe present in all of Kafka’s work has it’s own word, Kafkaesque. It’s strange and somewhat unclear, and yet its presence in everything I have read has invoked introspection, as it is somehow applicable in my life (and I’m sure almost anyones life at some point) even in our modern society, decades after the story was written."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 23, 2017","To conclude I would say just one thing. Kafkaesque: having a nightmarishly complex, bizzare or illogical quality. Never in the history of Literature was such an extraordinary honor given to an author. Neither a praise, nor a sorrowful pat on the back to say it's okay. Just an observation. Just a definition. Admiration and salutations to Franz Kafka."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 27, 2022","This was the first book of Franz Kafka that I have read. The dictionary definition of Kafkaesque - having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality - I overall found the book to be like the definition."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 1, 2023","In a very kafkaesque manner, the story is told like an everyday tale, making you feel uncanny while reading it when you realize the extent of the story. Kafka managed to write the most obscure things while making you feel like it's normal until you get ripped out of that feeling in certain moments."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"June 20, 2022","the metamorphosis was the epitome of the kafkaesque/dark academia vibes [meaning extremely depressing and quite nerve-racking], and whilst it wasn't necessarily... entertaining, it's a book that makes you think [which is exactly what i was looking for btw]."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 15, 2025","I finally did it and picked up this story, so yay me. The feeling of satisfaction at having ticked something off a bucket list isn't setting in quiet yet, and I have a vague feeling that I will go full circle and think that I haven't read this now that I actually have, just as I used to be convinced that I already had until now. If this sentence doesn't make any sense, yes it does. It's kafkaesque. Other than that, I felt genuinely sorry for Gregor, and even more sorry for Kafka because at times, Vladimir Nabokov's commentary was more entertaining than the story itself."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 18, 2018","They coined a word 'Kafkaesque' and by Jove Frank Kafka deserved it. The book, though short, leaves a lasting impression. The book shows the different aspects of the human psyche, inspects the fragile human relationships. There is a dark humor in the way Kafka narrates the story."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 29, 2022","I would call this kafkaesque, but I'm pretty sure that's a cop-out."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 4, 2019",very kafkaesque

The Metamorphosis,5,"April 18, 2024",Feeling so kafkaesque rn. The paragraph about rotten apple in his back shattered my heart. I love you Gregor Samsa💔🪳
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 31, 2024",Sensational - I can now use the adjective kafkaesque in my day-to-day life without feeling like a hypocrite.
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 1, 2025","Everyone makes out like this is really absurd but i think it could have been more absurd…. brilliant writing though hilarious and thought provoking and gut wrenching, at least I can use the term Kafkaesque with strong certainty now"
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 19, 2025",yo that’s kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 9, 2022",this is literally so Kafkaesque no way
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 14, 2025",Kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,2,"January 25, 2025",I had a lot of trouble engaging with this story. I guess you could say my experience was rather Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 25, 2021","This was the most unsettling (and stress-provoking) book I’ve ever read. I read an essay about Kafkaesque philosophy a few years back, and perhaps that’s why the meaning of The Metamorphosis settled over me so quickly; I understood the purpose of the confusing and overwhelming nonsense. If you go in without a bit of background, the absurdness may be distracting—almost comic. But by the end of this short novel I was so drained and sad for Gregor that Kafka could have written literally anything and it wouldn’t have felt out of place."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"November 29, 2023",can finally start saying kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 2, 2025",Now I can call things “Kafkaesque” with integrity.
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 27, 2020","Kafkaesque writing leaves you disoriented and so I was prepared for it. There are several interpretations to this plot. But I won't influence you with what I think Kafka was alluding to. I implore you to discover it for yourself. However, before you read the story, get yourself acquainted with Kafka's life, because all his works have a biographical edge to them."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 25, 2020",Good! Very Kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 1, 2020","Metamorphosis is a book by Franz Kafka, a German writer. The word “Kafkaesque” traces its roots to this author for the bizarre and illogical plots that are narrated in his books. Metamorphosis is such a book where the protagonist, Gregor Samsa, turns into a bug, one sunny day. The way he adjusts to his new life and how people around him acclimatize to his transformation is the rest of the story. Though several meanings of the story have been derived, I feel it to be a story about the author himself, and many others who are not treated with dignity and are deprived of parental love in a family or society. The method of treatment and the words that are voiced against the bug in the story sometimes feels justified when the trauma experienced by the family is understood. A good read for people who love stories with deep philosophical meanings."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 10, 2017","Kafka is primarily known for his absurd, surreal, or what can be generalized as ‘weird’ stories with kooky characters and concepts. There’s a reason why&nbsp;Kafkaesque term was coined."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 11, 2015","Anybody who can give birth to a new term altogether (Kafkaesque) with his/her writings certainly is one of a kind. But then that's what he was. I first heard of ""The Metamorphosis"" from my father. Like a lot of other books. During a random discussion one day, he said he had a vague memory of a book and quoted the first line ""As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."" He couldn't recall what the book was called or who the author was. I was slightly amused back then about this, especially because it wasn't something like ""Call me Ishmael"". I'm not in the least bit now though."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 5, 2017","I had heard and read about “Kafkaesque” everywhere and had only known the wikipedia meaning of the word. But to understand what it really means, one should read his work. In simple words, it is when you enter a surreal world in which all your control patterns, all your plans, the whole way in which you have configured your own behavior, begins to fall to pieces, when you find yourself against a force that does not lend itself to the way you perceive the world. You don't give up, you don't lie down and die. What you do is struggle against this with all of your equipment, with whatever you have. But of course you don't stand a chance. That's Kafkaesque."""
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 11, 2022","Often, for society, the problem with the outer and inner metamorphosis of an individual is not its happening per se, but everything that stops being done as a consequence. It’s funny how the characters that Kafka created in his works are called “Kafkaesque characters” as if they belong to some other world, when what they seem to represent are real individuals who suffer the consequences of everyday causes and who take that suffering as a given of reality. When Gregor (or perhaps Kafka) undergoes his metamorphosis, he feels, against his interior human existence, against his nauseous insect body, all the brutal oppression of the totalitarianism of society, of the family, and of his presence in a world that swats away problems like someone swats away the flies."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 8, 2014","I'll just say two things. First, that opening line, so often reproduced, really is just about perfect. Second, after reading this I think I have been wrong to allow any connotation of fearfulness to attach to my understanding of ""Kafkaesque"". Neither Gregor Samsa here nor K in The Castle is ever really afraid. The world is absurd, their situations are maddening, there is no escape, all can be lost (or gained) at any moment, but they are not really terrorized, so much as appropriately vexed."
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 10, 2016","The urban dictionary of 'Kafkaesque' is; having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality. Yup, that completely sums of this work of short stories by Franz Kafka. Also, all the stories feel unresolved where the protagonists story or ending just is...an ending (fade to black). The most interesting is probably one of his most famous, ""The Metamorphosis."" However, as in all of these works, there is no reason why or real purpose. I will say this about Kafka's writing style. Even though he was born in Prague, Czech Repulic in 1883 -- his writing style (translated), is very modern and does not bog down. It just does not give the reader any hope or outcome that their time spent reading his work was that...time well spent."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 31, 2014","The book is only 50 pages. Read it, so you don't have to wonder what the word kafkaesque means."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 8, 2024",Jeg digger Kafka og liker hvordan han får oss til å tenke. «Kafkaesque». I boken så er Georg Samsa er protagonisten som våkner opp en dag og finner ut at han har blitt et innsekt. Boken følger jo hva som skjer etter han har blitt og vi leser mye om hvordan familien reagerer. De tar avstand og foreldrene later som om han ikke finnes. Jeg opplever boken som meget trist og det syntes jeg gjør den sterk (chef referanse) jeg får medfølelse med protagonisten.
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 18, 2020","With all the hue and cry about the book, maybe I went in with a lot of expectations or didn't understand the subtext, but wouldn't rate it 5. I can read the origin of the 'Kafkaesque' idea, but I wouldn't read it twice."
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 30, 2023","On my second reread I could appreciate the literary marvel people term as ""Kafkaesque"". One writing skill to pick for me is how the author stitches multiple phrases into lengthy descriptive sentences that fit so well."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 28, 2021",very kafkaesque...

The Metamorphosis,5,"May 2, 2025",Very kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 22, 2025","Recalling a Franz Kafka story almost feels like trying to explain a dream you had the night before, with clouded themes and seemingly nonsensical backgrounds, yet you are left with strong impressions even if you do not know exactly where from. I feel as though this effect which is experienced through his disruptively improbable and beautifully expressionistic writing is what not only garnered his notoriety as a writer, but also produced distinctive terms such as “Kafkaesque” to describe something as “bizarre, illogical, or nightmarish-ly complex”- in essence and by definition, this is what his work reflects."
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 20, 2020",It's a bleak story but one that captures the Kafkaesque spirit
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 4, 2024","And true to Kafka's style of writing, the story does not really have a conclusive ending, and instead it just ends with a bitter after taste where the family can easily move on without Gregor after they've figured out how to live life without his money and now without the burden of a vermin living in their house. Now that's Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,3,"June 24, 2023","- Intially upon finishing the book, I found myself underwhelmed with the story. But after reading more about the symbolism and different interpretations of the book, and about Kafka's life and the 'Kafkaesque' writing style, I was able to appreciate and understand the embedded themes in it much better. Alienation, isolation and absurdity of human existence."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 14, 2023","I now understand when people refer to things as Kafkaesque. The story regards a Traveler who is witnessing an execution. The ""criminal"" is judged to be guilty without having the opportunity to mount a defense. Could this be a metaphor for original sin or just an example of living under tyrannical rule?"
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 25, 2020",The only thing I knew about Kafka was his 'Kafkaesque Bureaucracy' but after reading Metamorphosis I wish to read more of him.
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 21, 2023","I read this book in just one sitting and was immediately drawn to learning about Kafka. I have not read any of his works before and only knew him through the term ""kafkaesque.” Learning about his life definitely helped me understand the profound sadness that pervades the book."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 29, 2020","Anyway, I liked Metamorphis quite a lot and it feels deceptively multi-layered, even though it is unclear what Kafka actually wanted to say with it. It is interesting to ponder about the actual true meaning of Mr Samsa's unfortunate fate - is it a comment on capitalistic society? A treatise on alienation? A comment as to how we treat people who don't conform to societal norms? Or just a weird story (which in a good way describes the feeling of something being Kafkaesque - which is actually a word ...)? I don't know (and apparently Kafka didn't like discussing his books)."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 11, 2019",The kafkaesque feeling of it comes from the powerlessness of the character. The only thing left to him and his family is to deal with the situation. Here's where we see the brilliance of the story. How would you and your family react to a sudden change in family dynamics? How far would you go for the people you love? What would make you change the image you have of a loved one and vice versa? Among a series of reflections that the book brings you.
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 2, 2023","La Métamorphose de Franz Kafka est l’une histoire les plus tristes ou «&nbsp;kafkaesque&nbsp;» si vous préférez (confuse, désagréable et on ne peut plus injuste dans son absurdité d’avènement) que j’ai eu la chance de lire. C’est une histoire qui illustre trop brillamment l’absurdité qui habite notre vie de tous les jours, une vie dans laquelle nous sommes tellement préoccupé par le travail et par la routine inéchangeable que d’être transformé en cloporte ne soit en réalité qu’un inconvénient mineur."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 19, 2022",Finally I truly understand the meaning of Kafkaesque! I had been waiting to read Kafka for a long time but I always got distracted by other books.
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 18, 2019","இனம் புரியாத, காரணமே இல்லாத பயத்தினை குறிக்கும் வார்த்தையை Kafkaesque என்கிறது ஆங்கில அகராதி. அதற்கு முன் வார்த்தையே இல்லாத ஒரு மனநிலையை தனது படைப்புலகத்தில் உருவாக்கியவர் ஃப்ரன்ஸ் காஃப்கா. தந்தையின் கண்டிப்பு, பிடிக்காத வேலையை நிர்பந்தத்தின் பேரில் செய்த தவிப்பு, எழுதுவதற்கு நேரம் கிடைக்காமல் போனது, அதனால் தற்கொலை முயற்சி, பாலியல் வேட்கை, தன் உடல் மீதான சந்தேகம் என தனது மொத்த அழுத்தத்தையும் இலக்கியமாக படைத்துள்ளார்."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 26, 2020",It took me on a journey through those 99 pages. Truly made me realise what Kafkaesque means.
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 13, 2023","With Metamorphosis, I finally dive into my much-awaited experience of Kafkaesque. I have heard people say that Kafka isn't for everyone but for me, he is. Should I be proud, or should I be alarmed?"
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 31, 2021","Made a great decision by reading it again this year as the last book of the year 2021, because I enjoyed it a lot. More than I thought I would. Was definitely too young and too lethargic in class to read it. Metamorphosis is very nostalgic to me, even had a presentation about Franz Kafka with my best friend back then. A great piece of art. A great author. Kafkaesque is a genre of its own."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 11, 2023","I’ve always had an idea what “Kafkaesque” meant, but needed to make my foray into his work to know where the essence of it comes from."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 6, 2023","The Kafkan (and not Kafkaesque) absurdity of Metamorphosis is greatly overstated. Although true that the catalyst for the story is absurd: a man without much to reproach turning into a cockroach, the rest of the story seems more in line with how a family deals with grief. You could say that it mostly resembles someone having suffered a terrible accident which leaves them paralysed for life, and their family having to come to peace with having to pull the plug."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 22, 2017","The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka perfectly illustrates the meaning of the word ""kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 9, 2020","Personally, I think this story draws on how Franz himself felt. He was the eldest in his family, with three sisters. He was engaged a few times, but never married and frequented brothels a good part of his life. Without telling his whole life story, I would surmise that he often felt like the vermin depicted. An outsider misunderstood and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Either way, Fanz was able to make a large enough impact that Kafkaesque is now in the dictionary. Enjoy!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 8, 2021","I've read enough gloomy, painful stories to be used to concepts such as alienation, loneliness, undefeatable fate, and agony in them but this one still could make me weep over the first character's suffering, his inability to utter that he understands others while the others don't and the fact that he is not just alienated from others but also himself. All these as well as Kafkaesque great depiction in his books and also the fact that Kafka himself was such a tortured person in his life as he struggled to survive despite many misfortunes in his hard life and some dialogues and fragments were somehow his autobiography made this short story one of my most favorites."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 9, 2024","The absurdity of this novella is unrelenting. From Gregor’s lack of concern regarding his transformation into a giant bug, to the slow, sad realization - by the reader, not the protagonist - that Gregor’s family members have taken him for granted and even taken advantage of him financially, Kafka demonstrates his ability to fill readers with a very special kind of existential dread. Every bit of this book lives up to the legacy of the term “Kafkaesque”."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 10, 2024","This books is deep with some eye-opening reality of how cruel and unfair life can be. Loved the description of Gregor Samsa turning into a beetle. His transformation leads to unravel how he is treated when he is turned useless. His problems of getting to work, and struggles to help his needy family is a portrayal of a rational being trying to move ahead despite of adversities. A big lesson in this classic piece of literature style- ""Kafkaesque"". A book worth mulling over."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 3, 2018",Got a good taste of Kafkaesque in The Metamorphosis. It is very different in style.
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 11, 2020","SOOo creepy so crawly!! My introduction to Kafkaesque worlds. It was incredibly upsetting and uncomfortable. Poor pitiful Gregor. I could see the story vividly from Gregor's isolated low angle with a distorted fish eye lens looking up at all the various characters. The commentary of this book on our normal lives, responsibilities and interactions with each other in this modern world is interesting. Seeing it through Gregor's eyes it seems kind of frivolous and pointless yet we feel such sorrow for him not being able to communicate or function in it. This book grasped a true sense of isolation and dissociation."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 3, 2023","S/o to Max Brod, Kafka's best friend, who did the honorary thing and published Kafka's work despite his dying request that Brod burn all of his writing. Thanks to him we have the subgenre magical realism, the term kafkaesque, and Gregor the giant insect. Iconic."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 16, 2024",Can I say this was Kafkaesque?
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 24, 2024","And in many respects those haters are right. But I think this book is so beautiful. You really have to appreciate Kafka and what people mean by Kafkaesque to understand this book. In many ways, it explores the absurdity of life. Gregor’s life is absurd and he spends the majority of the book trying to make sense of the absurdity. Though we might not wake up as giant bugs- our lives are often absurd as Gregor’s- a theme which Kafka illustrates beautifully in this book."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 15, 2018",It was very...Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 1, 2022",I read this during the kafkaesque experience getting the plane back from Switzerland. I felt that it was a fascinating story to discuss after finishing it but I found the experience of reading it uncomfortable and I didn’t really enjoy the style of writing!
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 28, 2024","I read this before going to Prague since Kafka is from there. I really liked it! I think it has feminist undertones, but I can’t tell if I’m reaching. My favorite element is of course the absurdity. I’m realizing that absurdism is an auto-love for me and Kafka’s flavor of absurdism is no exception! It was delightful to read this before seeing the Kafkaesque monuments around Prague."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 24, 2021","Tldr: would you still love me if I was a bug? (not as good as America, but still just as Kafkaesque as Jesse Pinkmans rehab group leader would say 😉)"
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 12, 2022","Hmm yes, quite Kafkaesque i'd say"
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 19, 2022","true story i only read a work of kafka so i could be annoying and say things like ""this is so kafkaesque"""

The Metamorphosis,4,"December 25, 2018","Now I truly understand the meaning of 'Kafkaesque' and I have to admit, the audiobook read by Benedict Cumberbatch might have played a key role in how much I liked the book."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"September 3, 2021",i can finally describe myself as kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"November 19, 2021",kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 31, 2022",this was so kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 15, 2024",Con: every time I hear kafka I think about that scene in The Squid and the Whale where Jesse Eisenberg describes The Trial as kafkaesque. That's hardly kafka's fault but still. Yowch
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 5, 2025",Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 21, 2023","Heartbreaking, bizarre and beautifully written. Totally kafkaesque bro."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 12, 2024",So kafkaesque 🪳
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 6, 2023","A good book but with all the hype built around the famous story of Metamorphosis, I felt quite bored following the exciting first part of the story. It lacked a sense of logic, which is the point, but a boring lack of logic that could still have kept my attention better. The other two stories that accompany this one, In the Penal Colony, and The Judgement, we’re certainly better at doing that. There was the Kafkaesque nature evoked but retained both intensity and command of the readers attention. Overall, a worthy read but the expectations need to be rebalanced."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 23, 2024",This book is no doubt “Kafkaesque.”
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 20, 2018","You know you've had a big impact on the literary world when your name is used as a positive adjective to describe other books. To be Kafkaesque is to be strange, oppressive, absurd and this little book lives up to that. I've learned that I particularly enjoy books that start out with the ""what"" and then spend much of the book exploring the ""why"" or in this case ""how do people react"". Though strange, this book has had a weird staying power with me. I think of this book more often than I'd expect as I think of how absurd elements of our world truly are. A great read, if only for its outsized impact on the world of literature."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 27, 2020","""Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka is an allegorical novella tackling the theme of alienation with autobiographical elements. He created a world of Kafkaesque through this book which is discernible but not quite real, neatly detailed and yet dreamlike. The term depicts one's sense of finding oneself victimized by large impersonal forces and feeling haunted too, by the sense that may be, after all, he deserves it."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 27, 2023",i cannot tell what is the most kafkaesque trait that can be highlighted — realism or absurdism.
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 14, 2025","everyone look out, i’m gonna start dropping the word “kafkaesque” into casual conversation🪳"
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 21, 2022",Feeling kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,2,"October 21, 2022","Benedict Cumberbatch's narration definitely improved the experience, for me, of this Franz Kafka classic. I suppose I got what I asked for when I picked up this novella to better understand the meaning of the term ""Kafkaesque."" I'm left at the end confused, sad, conflicted, and darkly amused at the same time. Perhaps writer and creative writing professor Ben Marcus captured it better: ""A setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness - hopelessly and full of hope."""
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 4, 2024",this book was so kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 14, 2024",Totally Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 28, 2025","Man, if I were a bug, I would have SO MUCH more fun than Gregor Samsa. That guy seems like a real drag, bug or man. :) (I'm still reflecting on the meanings of the story, which I did overall enjoy, but there was less adventurous scuttling than I'd hoped. That wouldn't have been as Kafkaesque, though.)"
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 11, 2020",A must read for anyone trying to understand the Kafkaesque phenomena.
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 27, 2023","Well. This was a quick descent into a more and more pathetic situation, and now I have a better idea of what people mean when they say ""Kafkaesque"". I can understand why it's a classic, it hits hard and fast, I'd recommend anyone reading this as good general literature knowledge as it only takes a couple of hours anyway!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 27, 2025",There are multiple derivations of this story and the more you think about it the more you realize how they differently fit into the mundane narratives of our lives. This is what we call ‘Kafkaesque’.
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 4, 2017","Well, only one word for this discussion: … Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 15, 2017","But I had no idea -- was unprepared for the bleakness, the sorrow wrapped in the mundane - the aching of the everyday...of course, it being Kafkaesque (hahaha), maybe I should not be so surprised... I have angst and feel pity over and for Gregor...yet, not so...it will not be forgotten. A most excellent story. I find the following 2008 review from a fellow goodreader (user: Ken) interesting:"
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 26, 2022",v kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 15, 2022",kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 30, 2025","Reading just one of his works it’s easy to understand why a separate descriptor, Kafkaesque, had to made for it, as it’s so entirely unique. The conflicts with his characters inner selves, the absurdity yet complete acceptance of it, the bureaucratic injustice that his protagonists just have to withstand, all of these connect Kafka’s works together."
The Metamorphosis,2,"July 15, 2013","Even someone like myself who had never read the (blessedly short) novella is familiar with the basic story if they are even tangentially educated in the Western literature canon. Traveling salesman Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning in his familiar bedroom in the family home to discover that, overnight, he has turned into a giant insect. What ensues is a senseless and disorienting story of menacing complexity and surreal distortion. In other words, it is the pure definition of Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 19, 2020","It's a really dark and depressing sort of book. I guess one can appreciate some of the Kafkaesque category of work. No real morals or whatever from it. Just that shit happens, you live with it, try to make sense and then die."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 6, 2024","Outside of The Metamorphosis, I've never read any other Kafka stories. This book remedied that and gave me a whole new appreciation for the term ""Kafkaesque."""
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 14, 2020","I have postponed reading Kafka multiple times because I love Kafka. His life, his letters to Milena, the essence of 'Kafkaesque', everything. Whenever some excerpts from Kafka's work came up on my IG feeds, I let the world around go numb and read and related. There was this fear that if I knew him more, read him, I will be left with the shattered pieces of a life I idolized. What if his works were so vague, sounded pretentious or were redundant with the works and issues discussed by authors like Camus or Dostoevsky? But this collection of short stories by Kafka, being one of the best books I have ever read if not the best, makes me fall in love with him and his works even more."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 31, 2016","Although to a trenchant reader the undercurrent of the book is a pastiche from the get-go, the prose is in itself a very elementary narrative, and possesses no groundbreaking virtues or distinguishably 'unreal' atmosphere to contribute in any way to the etymology of the word 'Kafkaesque'. As this is my first Kafka outing, my hopes are pinned on 'The Trial', Kafka's most acclaimed literary work."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 6, 2025","A few years ago, I tried reading The Metamorphosis, but I couldn’t get past the first chapter. Actually, I tried many times to read it, but I just couldn't immerse myself in it. I would always put it down, dismissing it as some ""stupid bug story"" that, at the time, made no sense to me. To be honest, because I didn’t find it meaningful or understand why it was considered a ""classic"", I used to argue that the book—and Kafka, by extension—was overhyped. However, a few days ago, I stumbled upon an interview with Sylvia Plath, and shortly afterward, a video by Pursuit of Wonder was suggested to me. The video explained the term ""Kafkaesque,"" and although I initially clicked on it out of curiosity (maybe because the thumbnail intrigued me), I soon found myself utterly fascinated."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 5, 2017",Some say Kafka tried to show his own inexplicable feelings of alienation (which we now rightly term as 'Kafkaesque'&nbsp; ) being a German-speaking Jewish in the city of Prague and being haunted by feelings of inferiority complex because of the daunting nature of his father and his upbringing in such a dominating environment...
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 27, 2025","My first Kafka read. Comical. What was this guy on?? I love it. I had been watching hours upon hours of ""Kafkaesque"" videos prior to reading this. Did that skew my perspective? Likely. Though understanding the conceptual goal of Kafka's books was really important for me to think about while reading. Admittedly, this book is a little bit weird and quirky, but it is a great example of symbology that seems to get smarter every time I think about what was written."
The Metamorphosis,2,"April 4, 2023","Vraiment kafkaesque comme expérience, comme on dit dans le jargon."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 24, 2022",This book's writing style is so different that it created an entire different genre. Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 3, 2022",This book has left a very deep impression on me. Hearing about 'the kafka-trap' and 'kafkaesque' through my whole teenage years made me curious of who this man named kafka was.
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 6, 2012",I teared up when Gregor died because it felt like Kafka was writing and executing his own suicide through this book. A man who feels he is a giant cockroach with no sense of escape and nothing to live for is just really too tragic. There is a reason that his writing created the idea of a Kafkaesque tone.
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 18, 2021","- People who inspired by his writing and ideas and used same in their writing generate this whole idea of ""Kafkaesque"""
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 16, 2020","Simply you can't read a Kafkaesque masterpiece and you don't feel astonished and amazed , that's impossible lol ."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 7, 2020","When I was done reading and driving myself crazy about what to make of it, I thought I'd look up the author. After reading a little about his life I found out that his other work is similarly incomprehensible but equally insightful and that he died not knowing how he had paved the way to modern literature. To think the little work he's so well known for today lay catching dust in his bedside drawer as he died and wouldn't even have seen the light of day if it wasn't for his friend who despite Kafka's wish to burn it all, preserved and published it, is kafkaesque to say the least. Yes, there is a word defining the characteristics of his works derived from his own name. I would highly recommend this book to those who aren't afraid of being tortured by the words and plagued by the unexplainable understanding of the reality that is the metamorphosis."
The Metamorphosis,2,"April 21, 2010","These stories are dry, humorless, contrived, awkward, and overly-earnest in tone. I had always heard the phrase ""Kafkaesque"" applied to situations that are dreary and bureaucratic, like standing in line at the DPS. I always assumed that this was because the characters in Kafka's stories were faced with these types of situations and had to overcome them. However, I now realize that the term ""Kafkaesque"" actually refers to the reader's situation, because each of Kafka's short stories, from the reader's perspective, is a tiny, cramped, and completely monotonous prison cell. His stories, despite trying so hard to be bizarre, are just gray. I would like to give the man credit for maybe writing in a very meta way; maybe he was deliberately trying to simulate a feeling of oppression and frustration in his readers to make his theme all the more salient? But I honestly don't think he had the cleverness or tongue-in-cheekness to pull that off. I think he was just an overly serious, possibly disturbed or drug-addled man who substituted imagination with dreams or drugs. Speaking of which, the critics who try to read too much into ""A Country Doctor,"" a story based on one of Kafka's dreams, represent everything that people hate about literary critics. And shame on Kafka for being so self-absorbed that he thought anyone other than himself would want to read a recounting of one of his nonsensical fever dreams."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 10, 2015","Forget the absurdity of it- the story and its message is a fine one. That's why it has lasted . It is not a rollicking tale but it's not a hard read, either. The word ""Kafkaesque"", meaning a bit funny, has worked its way into the English language because of this man's genius. We can benefit from it. 5/5"
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 27, 2020","KAFKAESQUE: The feeling of alienation, anxiety, guilt, self-disgust and absurdity"
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 20, 2022","I say it again, the feeling when you didn't quite understand what the meaning is, and when you finally realize that it was there and it made sense all along, is something I never felt outside this Kafkaesque universe."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 10, 2025","Indeed, Kafka and Kafkaesque are notions that come up in conversation, films, other books or plays, one example is…Kafka’s Dick http://realini.blogspot.com/2016/07/k... so we could argue that even the penis of the immortal author has entered history, Alan Bennett is not a second rate scribbler, he has some fantastic oeuvres, such as The Uncommon Reader (wherein the Queen of Britain starts…reading and that is causing a furor) The History Boys, 40 Years On"
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 6, 2013","Having a lifetime chance to live in a city where Kafka was born made me finally decided to have Kafkaesque experience just like my husband did. I picked one that he already read, and this book is said to be Kafka's masterpiece."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 2, 2016",So finally I stumble upon a book which I find hard to say anything about. I kind of feel empty/strange/dry in a way Kafkaesque after reading this short story an impact that I feel should have been obvious. Is that just it! Its about alienation &amp; parent-child conflict but I wanted there to be something more that eventually wasn't there &amp; I was just kept longing. Was he imagining things or was it real.
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 5, 2025","After reading this book, I did some research about Kafka because even though I heard of him before, I didnt really know him at all. And I was just so captivated by his Kafkaesque, an absurd nightmarish situation that can be interpreted in real world. For The Metamorphosis, I cannot get any good message that can uplift me, because the story is depressing. But somehow, I felt understood and heard because the book albeit fiction and a bit absurd, depicts the reality of what does it feel like feeling useless and alienated. well maybe there is a good message in the book. Hopefully it can remind people that healthy communication and unconditional love are crucial and so important for humanity."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 3, 2020","Although this Kafkaesque beginning hailed as a classic, but I can imagine that , in its recently released early nineteenth century , the readers are probably very difficult to accept this without bedding absurd wording. It clearly describes things that are almost impossible , but they say it in a calm and logical tone that describes the facts ."
The Metamorphosis,1,"May 27, 2021","This tragic novel, not surprisingly, translates the views of a complex man who once believed that the human race is nothing but the product of one of “God’s bad days"". The book is a real embodiment of Kafkaesque, as it puts us in a surreal world in which all patterns, methods and ways that configure human behaviours begin to fall into pieces, provoking endless questions and unleashing countless doubts about the relation with oneself, surrounding, people, existence, life, God and eternity."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 27, 2025","Entrei neste livro com pouco conhecimento sobre o estilo Kafkaesque. Contudo, acabei de descobrir como esta obra aborda o absurdo de uma maneira tão brilhante. Kafka retrata a sociedade e como a mesma trata os que são diferentes ou que já não podem “contribuir” pela perspetiva de Gregor Samsa, um caixeiro viajante que um dia acorda num corpo de um inseto gigante. Vemos a luta interna de Samsa a lidar com o isolamento e a alienação imposta pela família do mesmo, pois assim que ele não pode contribuir financeiramente, o mesmo é descartado, sendo visto como um fardo."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 27, 2017","Kafkaesque :- I finally understood what Kafkaesque means too. It's not just one's inability to get out of an absurd situation in which he is bound to fail. It's also his failure to see the absurdity. It's also his constant denial of things as absurd they are and instead taking the blame on oneself. I thought Gregor was a hero but in reality he's actually an anti-hero. He turns into an insect and he's suffering from pain and misunderstanding and loathe all the book long. He care too much about his family. He wants to make life easy for them. He doesn't even think much about his current state as bad as it stands. And lastly when he comes to listen to music, his family condemns him to die. They no longer sympathize with him. This book doesn't come with a happy ending. It shows a very good picture of where we stand."
The Metamorphosis,2,"May 2, 2021","What my review really comes down to is the fact that I didn't enjoy reading Die Verwandlung. I know it's a classic, and I can see the elements of it that came to create the concept of being ""Kafkaesque"" in the oppressive &amp; nightmarish world that Gregor inhabits as an insect. However, I found the exact message/meaning of the novella to be inscrutable. I read a number of articles where people confidently laid out the core themes &amp; messages of the novella - but each of them were different. I'm all for criticism of capitalism, but I'm not even sure if that's what this novella is about? Anyway, in addition to the undefined meaning, I found all of the characters to be absolutely unlikeable &amp; I hated having to see things through Gregor's indefatigably morose eyes. God, really my problem is just that it was excruciatingly depressing. A man gets turned into a bug, is super depressed about it and a burden on his family, and then dies. Would recommend as a classic because it's really short, but also I thought it was awful."
The Metamorphosis,2,"August 20, 2012","Before reading this book, I'd heard many things about it. Words like ""boring,"" ""worst book ever."" So I did a little research before. Kafka wrote this book during a literary time period known as Existentialism. This was basically a philosophical movement about being individual or alone. The way I interpreted this in the book was that when Gregor's family abandoned him he was all by himself, alone with his own thoughts. The family he once always provided for was falling apart and all the weight of that was put on his shoulders (or shell per se) While most of my classmates found this book to be boring and awful, I enjoyed it a little when I really thought about some of the deeper meanings in the words beyond him being a bug. While it was portrayed in an extremely odd fashion, trying to figure out the metaphors and analogies in the words was fun for me. I wouldn't say it was one of the best books I've ever read, but I didn't mind reading it for summer reading. After all, the writer was good enough to get his own word, Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 18, 2014","To attempt to analyze this short literary marvel would be a mistake, it’d be enough to say that every ‘thinking’ person should check it out at sometime or other. The tale in true Kafkaesque style brings our worst nightmare to reality, thereby making us realize that there exists another life that we all lead–the one in our dreams that we seldom give much importance to. Anyone could relate to this at once beautiful, comical, painful and wistful story of an ordinary man who wakes up one day to find himself transformed into an insect."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 2, 2017","This is a very strange and surreal novel, or, as it's otherwise known, Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 13, 2023","I don't love Kafka's writing style. His works (like The Castle) often descend into (occasionally charming but) long, rambling, and under-punctuated paragraphs that dauntingly take up a whole page. However, the atmosphere that is created in the process is second to none, and truly deserving of its own term: Kafkaesque. In my opinion, ""The Metamorphosis"" is the idea that was made for Kafka's inherent style. The absurd simplicity of the concise plot mixed with powerful allusions to mental illness, the lower-class family dynamic, and existential pain bind together to make ""The Metamorphosis"" the most harmonious Kafka work I've read yet."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 28, 2022","A collection of stories short in length, but much complex in their plots and meanings hidden behind the words themselves... It is hard to describe this book, but the word Kafkaesque is probably the only one which fits. It shows people in desperate situation, helpless and not seeing a way out of them. Motives of emotional coldness and inhumanity are present on many occasions... The metamorphosis itself is inspired by Kafka's own relationship with his family and at least to me is partly a metaphor to how we cruel can families be, to their member, who may be old or very ill. They took care of their families for years, but now, when they are in need, the rest of their families see them as burdens, that need to be dealt and don't even think about repaying the debt they owe them. It was an extraordinary, quite depressing experience, but absolutely worth it."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 17, 2023","I'm finally beginning to grasp what ""Kafkaesque"" means - it's an extremely unique kind of fictional writing that you know for sure is fiction, yet somehow the author makes it easy to look past the bizarreness so it doesn't feel unreal. Consequently, you find yourself locked in a dream world, that turns into a nightmare every so often."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 24, 2013","This is a prime example of the literature of ""affect"". Kafka is all about atmosphere and the feeling generated by his writing. He is astute, ironic and detached like Joyce's God, within and away from his creation, ""paring his nails"". I read The Metamorphoses 20 years ago and this re-reading brought back memories. Other stories had other peculiarities. I read ""Amerika"" a few years ago and had forgotten most of it but ""The Stoker"" reminded me of that book which I should re-read one of these days. 'The Hunger Artist' and 'A Report to the Academy' are hilarious. 'The Judgement' has typical Kafkaesque unexpected shocks and twists whereas 'The Penal Colony' is cold as the steel needles in the torture apparatus that it so vividly describes."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 11, 2013","This collection of stories deserves nothing less than 4 stars - Kafka is of course insightful and unique and this is worth reading for the intellectual exercise and cultural knowledge. I didn't give this 5 stars, mostly because I personally didn't enjoy reading the majority of it! Every day I live in a world of bureaucracy and idiotic details where my good intentions seem to not make any results. Why would I want to read a book to go through the same experiences? There were parts of the collection where I was utterly exasperated and drudged through. It was heavy, dark and annoying to me. The stories did leave a lasting impression on me, and I am sure I will draw some comparisons between them and my life in the future. Also, I know what ""kafkaesque"" means now!"

The Metamorphosis,5,"July 13, 2014","... Kafka writes a spiral one, which often makes readers dizzy, if not seasick. Interestingly, metamorphosis was one of Escher's favorite subjects, and three of his most famous woodcuts share this title with Kafka's novella. Metamorphosis, Anthony Thorlby argues, is the theme implicit in all Kafka's prose (""Kafka's Narrative: A Matter of Form""; see ""For Further Reading""). Kafka's content is somehow incongruous with his form, and as a result, the language must either undergo a metamorphosis itself to accommodate his pen, or perish-and sometimes it does both. At its best, Kafka's prose is re-formed into a new mode of signification; at its worst, his words are deformed, depleted, meaningless. In striving to fit his impossible situations into the feeble vehicle of language, Kafka knowingly embarks on a failed enterprise. He attempts to express the inexpressible. The Metamorphosis of his writing, Kafka's real accomplishment, takes readers to a place at once familiar and unfamiliar. Intrigued by this immediacy, critics have celebrated Kafka for his ""universality."" This flattery overreaches perhaps, but the term ""universal"" was not picked by accident. Kafka's fiction examines a universe largely unexplored in the literature preceding him, one full of implications that venture into the remote regions of human psychology. It's a universe with different rules than those governing our reality. And there's no map. But Kafka's universe nonetheless resonates deeply with who we are and who we've become. Early readers who hailed Kafka's universality had never seen their lives in books, and they had only dimly recognized the ""Kafkaesque"" as an unnamed thing. Kafka was among the first to describe bourgeois labor and its degrading impact on the soul. In his fable ""Poseidon,"" Kafka even portrays the god of the sea as consumed with tedious, never-ending paperwork. Kafka brings to mind a vocabulary of images-an endless trail of meaningless forms to be filled out, a death apparatus to rival Poe's pendulum, a man wearing a bowler hat, a gigantic insect. Thanks to interpretations like Orson Welles's film version of The Trial, Kafka's universe has expanded to include rows of office desks, oppressive light, and snapping typewriters. Kafka understood the trajectory of bureaucracy, and his literature predicts the nightmarish corporate world we live in today. Kafka's fiction, though concrete in its particulars, suggests an array of interpretive possibilities. ""The Metamorphosis"" alone has inspired Catholics to argue a case of transubstantiation, Freudians to extrapolate Gregor's castration by his father, and Marxists to infer the alienation of man in modern society. Kafka's descriptions vacillate between realism and allegory-a narrative style best described as parabolic. But unlike a traditional parable with an easy moral, Kafka's parables resist successful comprehension. This volume has as its parentheses Kafka's two best-known parables, ""A Message from the Emperor"" and ""Before the Law."" They both illustrate Kafka's near-nauseating ability to describe infinite regress. ""A Message from the Emperor"" checks any firm interpretation with its simple but devastating phrase ""or so they say"" in the opening line, which calls into question the tale's validity, as if the account ..."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 15, 2017","It is not about the story, but the novels of modern literature that explores the inside of man and narrates it with a unique rhythm style. In the beginning of the twentieth century modern literature, when these features began to make a big change in the novel, there is Marcel Proust in the beginning [Finding Lost Time]. It is a novel that is very intricate and requires a high level of concentration, but can be read intently and charmingly if it is tamed by the style. One of the most prominent writers of Proust, who is surely a very difficult work, is Franz Kafka, a Czech-born writer. I read [The Metamorphosis], saying that Kafka is the most 'Kafkaer' among the short stories of the collection of short stories. The word 'Kafkaesque' is also mentioned in the German dictionary, but when faced with a hypothetical but threatening situation in Kafka's literature, when You had a nightmare and felt like a scissor, or in some absurd reality It is said that it means such features when feeling a feeling of chin. It really seems to express the feelings after reading [The Trial] or [The Metamorphosis]."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 22, 2024","A Hunger Artist - The protagonist, a hunger artist who experiences the decline in appreciation of his craft, is typically Kafkaesque: an individual marginalized and victimized by society at large. ""A Hunger Artist"" explores themes such as death, art, isolation, asceticism, spiritual poverty, futility, personal failure and the corruption of human relationships. Critic Maud Ellmann argues that it is not by food that we survive, but by the gaze of others."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 16, 2025","3) The Stoker: A Fragment. I began to understand some elements of being ""kafkaesque"" when I started this story. There are no lengthy expositions; the scene is set within the first two sentences. Karl feels a sense of importance and pride defending the lowly Stoker, but becomes conflicted when it's revealed his uncle is a governor. He ends up taking his uncle's side, but is deeply conflicted. I think I've seen a lot of similar conflicts in college. In college, you learn about philosophy, morality, and learn about all sorts of injustice. Yet the same kids are taking prestigious jobs at consulting and finance companies, knowing that these companies (arguably) are a net negative to social good. And I can tell that they are conflicted, saying ""Oh, I'm only doing consulting because of x"" to justify their decision to themselves and others. Note that this is not an observation, not my judgement on consultants."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 19, 2020","Let me preface what I'm about to write with this: my rating is a reflection of my enjoyment alone. I think Metamorphosis is a stand out novel, whatever my feelings for it. How could I not? It's a classic deserving respect for a reason. That said, it was just a bit too... Kafkaesque? The grotesquerie and panic inducing paranoia were just not my style. I'm a sunshine, rainbows, mischief and magic person. I'm not a Kafka fan."
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 3, 2023",Tag: Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 9, 2023","Kafkaesque: ""Relating to, characteristic of, or resembling the literary work of Franz Kafka; marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity."""
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 15, 2025","Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a Jewish Austrian-Czech novelist and writer from Prague who wrote in German. He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, and typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.His best known works include the novella The Metamorphosis (1915) and the novels The Trial (1924) and The Castle (1926). The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his writing."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 30, 2022","What is the reader to think? Is Gregor’s state of mind some sort of irony or deliberate demonstration of the reproachfulness of that perspective and lifestyle? Maybe his actions and thoughts are meant to be as loathsome as his physical embodiment. But I feel this was not clear in the reading and the adoption of the term “kafkaesque” by society leads one to think that the weight of empathy lies with Gregor and not the family. To be sure, the radical change and the futility with which he at first fights and then begrudgingly accepts a world that will not change or accommodate his transformation is regrettable. But the tension and fulcrum of this narrative lies entirely in how his post transformational actions affect his family. Maybe the greatest sadness of the entire story is simply that the ceasing to be, the passing away of Gregor is met with relief and enthusiasm by his family instead of regret."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 13, 2023","The wrong way to live was Gregor working hard to pay for his family’s upkeep, but in doing so never getting a chance to enjoy his family (textbook Kafkaesque conundrum), and the right way to live, was the family at the end of the narrative, in uncertain financial times, but finally getting to sit together and laugh."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 3, 2021","besides being my birthday month, may now will be eternally marked as the month i had my first ever kafkaesque experience, for i'd read the metamorphosis, kafka's so-called magnum opus, for the very first time. but now, nearly a month later, here i am again, revisiting it once more as a way to celebrate kafka's birthday. i think there's something funny about how it is such a well-known and studied book and until may i was barely aware of its existence, and now not only have i devoured it completely once, i also have devoured it completely twice, savoring every word written in its 100 pages and allowing it to dwell in every corner of my brain. to begin with what all i want to purge out of my throat through my fingers, the plot of the book itself is something that can be easily described as shocking, yet what impressed me most about it, however, was how quickly we are thrown into samsa's odyssey along with the character and, without even being aware of the reason behind his metamorphosis, we simply accept it. it is something that needs no explanation—it's there because it's there. why? perhaps sometimes some things just lack plausible reasons. ""why do we get old?"", the young man asks. ""why do we get sick?"", the healthy man asks. ""why do we die?"", the alive man asks. ""because this is how it is"", the wise man answers. perhaps some things just lack explanation—samsa's transformation included."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 4, 2022","So yes, Kafka's loneliness was immense, subsequently having an influence on his writing. ""The Metamorphosis"" isn't all that different from his other works, a lonely protagonist, nightmarish landscape of prose and settings and the cherry on top surreal genre Kafka then creating his own brand of the sub-genre, the ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 17, 2016","It's clear that is is probably Kafka's most famous novella and many people often call fiction ""Kafkaesque"" whenever surreal, often absurd things happen, or whenever bureaucracy rears its bureaucratic head, but taken in the context of quite a lot of Central European writing (and Czech writing in particular) it's easy to see continent-local traditions at play. Though Kafka wrote in German and there's nothing overtly ""Czech"" in his writing, his whole focus on distinct non-reality is something that tends to crop up in a lot of other writing from that period and from that region. What makes this novella ""Kafkaesque"" at least for me, is the fact that it bears relationships two two other short stories ""The Stoker"" and ""The Judgement"" and a rather overt connection to Kafka's rather over-the-top ""Letter to My Father,"" a letter he wrote (but never sent) to his father, a man he often called ""the Tyrant."" The central protagonist (there may actually be two) is largely passive and does very little to change his conditions, and by the end of the story, a second transformation takes place, which made me wonder if the story was actually a clever telling of a totally different story all-together. I'm not giving away any spoilers but I will say that there IS a metamorphosis in this story: the literal, attention grabbing one, and the one that the story is probably about, which ultimately, has nothing to do with Gregor Samsa, the protagonist at all. This second metamorphosis takes place at the end of the story, and involves one of those viewpoint violations Kafka was so good at."
The Metamorphosis,2,"June 3, 2021",Kafkaesque:-
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 26, 2022","To say, The Metamorphosis is Kafkaesque would be ludicrous. I have read three books of Kafka, they are all entirely various in their story line the common thread being that the circumstances of the story which is atypical. Only Kafka can invoke the kind of emotions we feel by stating the reality in a fantastic manner. Only Kafka can take us on a ride right inside our hearts underneath our exteriors which of course is made up of different elements, that of fear, insecurity, boredom, isolation, pain, hurt and shame not to mention guilt."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 18, 2023","“Where is the plot?” was my immediate reaction after reading Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. Predetermined and perhaps a bit stubborn, I had written off the entirety of the novel as one that could have completed its plot events in a matter of three pages. However, after analyzing the unexpected multifaceted elements of the timeline of Gregor Samsa and the actions of his disturbing family, my viewpoint was altered as I solidified my takeaways. First, I realized Gregor has no chill. The power behind the Kafkaesque writing style is really, to its core, chilling because it shows the extremity of relatable human attributes and of course sprinkles in some monstrous fiction. Kafka toys with the dynamics of love, power, and self-worth, through Gregor’s unexplainable transformation into a “horrible vermin”. It not only destroys his life as he knows it, but also reveals the stark reality of being taken advantage of. Gregor’s excruciating naivety facilitates part of his misery and thus forces my pity for his unfortunate circumstances to alleviate because of his utter obliviousness. I cannot deny that his family’s dehumanization and abandonment of Gregor is rightly responsible for most of the trauma he endures, but it is his unwavering mindset that condemns him to having ‘no chill’. How is it possible for Gregor not to acknowledge his self-worth and realize his family’s overpowering glunty makes them unworthy of love? Even after his family neglects, abuses, admits their distaste, and views him only as a vessel of income, Gregor still continues to love and sacrifice himself for them (How irritating!). Gregor’s extreme selflessness prompts him to kill himself to cease burdening his family, further establishing the complex nature of the family’s relationships and static characterization. Although his family is elated with the discovery of Gregor’s death, this is not something I view as a good decision. I repeat, please do not kill yourself as an act of love for someone else, they probably wouldn’t want you dead if they really loved you. Anyways…Kafka plays with the tug and pull of the real-life issue of love and where the threshold between insanity, selflessness, and sacrifice lie. All the unanswered questions of origins, motives, and reasoning for the characters' reactions combined with the not so happy ending make not one of the book's features appealing, yet, it left me searching between the lines for the answers to all my questions and wanting more. (But hey, that’s just Kafka’s way)."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 5, 2024","I told myself I would read through classic literature one day, and that day has apparently come earlier than I expected. I knew of this story from the many references made to it throughout other stories and media, but all I really knew was that it was about a man who wakes up as a cockroach. All I knew of the author up until this point was that people referred to anything similar to his books as “Kafkaesque”. Immediately I wondered why he wasn’t screaming and more afraid of his predicament, especially when he tries to wave off his family when they are attempting to check on him through a locked door. I then suspected that this would be a more psychological story and that the protagonist hadn’t truly become a cockroach in the literal sense. Despite his complete physical transformation into an insect at the beginning of the story, Gregor changes very little as a character over the course of the story. Most notably, both as a man and as an insect Gregor patiently accepts the hardships he faces without complaint. The story shows us how in modern society humans are more cut off from one another and alienated from the human connections they used to have. Since it is an allegory, none of this is stated in the story. Instead, we see it in Gregor's isolation and alienation from his family and the rest of society. Kafka uses the symbolism of Gregor becoming a bug to represent the tragedy of the life that Gregor was leading, and his metamorphosis symbolizes a more gradual metamorphosis towards an individual humanity. Reading this story after the height of a global pandemic and my own personal isolation made this story all the more effective. A lesson that I learned from The Metamorphosis, is that life has to be lived for our own happiness. It may sound selfish, but in reality this is a cautionary tale about how you can become something unrecognizable if you dedicate your life to others, and how it can all end sooner than you could ever anticipate. Everything Gregor did he did not enjoy, and then he was turned into an insect and never got to do anything he liked. I see this story as a cautionary tale on how easy a life could be wasted if you live your life solely for others or for some societal “duty” that is placed upon you. Your life can only be beautiful if you curate it for yourself and not for others. Maybe that wasn’t the main intention of this story but that was what I got out of it, and I find it fitting."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 6, 2021","This is my introductory read to Franz Kafka. I've heard a lot of Kafka's works and how there is even a fabulous term that is thrown around to refer to his style of writing, 'Kafkaesque'. The idea of people divulging into predicaments of insane complexities that arise from legislature, judiciary systems or even circular reasoning. With all of this preamble, I was more than ready - with high expectations - to tackle this short story."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 6, 2023","My closing thoughts are such; while this may not be the most concisely written short story, it is certainly a marker of excellent symbolism, and worthy of the word that emerged from its author's name and reputation; kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 1, 2023","In conclusion, Kafka kinda ate with this one. On my way to understanding lynchian absurdist kafkaesque lovecraftian utilitarian nihilist post modern lars von trierian girlies."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 17, 2020","The Trial was one thing: absurdity, unrealness of bureaucracy, ""Kafkaesque."" But reading Kafka's shorter stories, one gets more the ""dream-like logic"" his reviewers talk about, his assimilation of Freudian concepts. They are not factual but they are true. They are not realistic but they are hyper real. He communicates to the heart of the matter, through story, to the heart of the mind. He is not heavy and tough - not at all pretentious - but extremely accessible and even, at times, quite funny. Nor do I find him depressing, as many say. For me there is nothing depressing about the truth. The truth is fresh air, clarifying, liberating. (""The need to let suffering speak is a condition of all truth"" -Theodor Adorno)"
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 24, 2025","Super short read for a day, one I enjoyed overall. I have been wanting to read this book for years, and it did not disappoint. I did not expect it to be quite humorous at times, as I have heard the Kafkaesque ideals were ones full of horror and isolation. The story of Gregor Samsa had me hooked, my main interest being curious as I had no iota of how it could unfold from the very beginning. The relationship with his family, both how he viewed them and how they viewed him broke my heart. Gregor felt like a burden, a waste of space meant to be ignored, eventually leading to his family having this same change of heart to believe the same towards the end. In a twisted way, I was reminded of how some terminally ill patients I have met have felt. They felt as if it was the end of the road for them, therefore a burden to anyone else who cared for them. The hush of the situation included, the feeling that your views are misunderstood (entirely, in the case of Samsa). I even saw much of how mentally ill people (myself from a couple years ago included) is entirely paralleled in the way of Gregor's thinking (makes sense as to why this metaphor is brought up often for the mentally ill). It can be easy when ill to feel as if you are a waste of space to everyone else around you, a bug on the wall whose tiny legs can barely hold its own weight, waiting to just be crushed. The waking up one day feeling physically unable to get out of bed, the arduous pains of doing simple tasks. His first thoughts being how do I get back to work? Not how do I heal? I do believe it was a great metaphor for this sentiment. The ending broke me to pieces. His family completely separated him from the person he used to be because of his transformation without the thought of the reverse of this mystical transformation could be possible. Alienation of the self, but also alienation to his family (incredibly interesting to see how the names of the parents are not mentioned until the end, and only the sister's when he was cared for; sister to their daughter. In general, this novella is what I imagine depression would feel like in a non-supportive environment, leading to the same demise we saw with Samsa."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 5, 2025","Still reading through some of the titular Other Stories, but I finally get the Kafka thing. It’s way subtler and funnier than the stereotype of “kafkaesque” labyrinths of alienation. Everyone seems to take his work a lot more deadly seriously than they ought."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 27, 2024","Reading Kafka is an experience that forces introspection, compelling us to question the very nature of our existence. His stories are not merely tales of individual suffering but profound meditations on the human condition. They evoke a sense of Kafkaesque dread, a term that has come to denote situations that are nightmarishly complex, bizarre, and illogical. This style bears a resemblance to the Russian story “The Nose” by Nikolai Gogol, where a man’s nose leaves his face and leads an independent life, embodying the absurdity and fragmentation of human identity. Life, in Kafka’s universe, is absurd and often cruel. It is a world where logic is subverted, and the only certainty is uncertainty itself. Yet, in this bleak landscape, there is a strange, haunting beauty."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 16, 2025","""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka is an undisputed classic. Everyone's heard of it, most have read it. So I was really glad to finally pick this short read up and understand what the hype was about...and I now know what ""Kafkaesque"" actually means."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 15, 2025","Kafkaesque - a term which can be used to describe situations characterised by absurdity, irrationality, or alienation and isolation.

I rarely even think about getting books from the ""You'll like this book because it's Fiction and there are like 16 different characters and you might relate with at least one of em, and then automatically love the plot hqhqhqhq"" shelves, because well... fiction. I could just watch some Sitcom instead. But Kafka here (who, fun fact, led to the induction of the word ""Kafkaesque"" into the dictionary, meaning ""characteristic or reminiscent of the oppressive or nightmarish qualities"" that his stories usually have) wasn't writing fiction, but channeling his daddy issues into a story, and who in their right minds would not want to have a piece of family drama in an extremely metaphorical manner? Long sentence eh? Nevermind. Our protagonist gets turned into a goddamn vermin and his family can't stand his appearance, and y'all are worried about long sentences? Society.... :( Okay jokes aside, our story revolves around a guy, who randomly gets turned into some insect one day, and who, even if has this immediate problem to tackle, is more worried about attending to his job, taking care of his family, getting his sister into a good institute, and this and that and blah and blah. However his family gets shit scared and literally goes ""Eww wtf stay away"" mode and one day, when he actually dies, they finally sigh and go out to take a walk, like ""Damn our son died, but that park looks nice."" Everything in between is just beautifully elaborated and the plot progression is *smacks lips* bheri kul. Too bad it's not a novel, but a 108 page novella and gets over in like 3 hours of reading.

The Metamorphosis,5,"December 13, 2017",'Kafkaesque' never existed in the English dictionary before late nineteenth century. Why? Were the phenomena that it describes inexistent prior to that? No. Kafka brought to words what life brought to heart in a way that no one ever did. It appears to me as if he was more attached to his writing than is safely possible. His work looks more like his own life as I read more about him. Most of his work remained incomplete and complex. Like his life.

There’s no explanation, no grand reveal—just a strange event that everyone gradually accepts. And maybe that’s what makes it so Kafkaesque. The absurdity isn’t in Gregor becoming an insect—it’s in how casually the world around him moves on. No doctors, no real panic, no pest control. Just quiet resignation."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 4, 2018",This extensional realism explored in this novel is something that would haunt most people but Kafka embodied his pain through his writings and this is a perfect example of his signature Kafkaesque style.
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 28, 2021","Much like everything else, I stumbled upon Kafka on YouTube. It was a video essay about his life, works, and how 'Kafkaesque' influenced modern Philosophy. Not only was I intrigued but I also teared up. Strangely, I found so many things about him relatable."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 22, 2024","One thing that struck me about this book is that, despite being written by Kafka himself, it wasn’t very “kafkaesque” by traditional definitions. the term usually is meant to invoke visions of powerful and overly complex bureaucracies, systems that completely crush the individual with their sheer size. the book certainly touches on some of these themes, but often only briefly."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 5, 2020","If it is hard to fathom just how absurd his writing is, I would like to mention that it led to the coinage of a literary adjective of it own, 'Kafkaesque' which is still used to refer to something that is eerily scary and weird."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 3, 2021","Metomophosis (1915) - Franz Kafka, tên tiếng việt “Hóa Thân”, là một truyện ngắn kể về anh chàng Gregor Samsa - một nhân viên chào hàng, không rõ lý do, bất ngờ bị biến thành hình hài một con bọ “gớm ghiếc” sau một đêm tỉnh dậy. Câu chuyện kể về những diễn biến tâm lý của các nhân vật xoay quanh gia đình Samsa làm trung tâm sau biến cố đầy hư cấu ấy. “Hóa Thân” là tác phẩm, có thể nói, là báu vật đặc sắc nhất trong số ít những tác phẩm của Franz Kafka. Quả xứng với sự nể trọng về những ý tưởng và lý tưởng mà người đời dành cho ông, Kafka đã nén viên kim cương “Hóa Thân” dưới hàng tỷ áp lực của các tầng ẩn dụ để khiến bản thân tác phẩm tỏa ra những vầng hào quang đủ làm soi rọi cả một triết lý thời đại, làm sáng mắt bất kỳ những kẻ thờ ơ, ngắn dạ và phiến diện nào. Franz Kafka không những đã thể hiện chất nghệ thuật “Kafkaesque” đậm đặc trong tác phẩm, lối viết tả ít gợi nhiều, để tạo nên cái lôi cuốn khó dứt trong văn phong kể chuyện, mà qua đó còn da diết tâm giãi bày, truyền tải những nội dung về số phận con người, gánh nặng thời cuộc đặt lên đôi vai người đàn ông nói riêng cùng tầng lớp lao động nói chung bấy giờ, cùng cả nỗi lòng thấu cảm giữa người với người."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 23, 2025","The Metamorphosis, by Kafka, is one of the most acclaimed pieces, based on the life of Gregor Samsa, a salesman who wakes up to find himself changed into a gigantic insect overnight. The narrative of this piece describes the extreme change in Gregor's life and reflects the heart of a ""Kafkaesque"" reality."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 14, 2017","David Rakoff is the reason I read this classic, cited by more people than have read it. I fall into this category for many classics thinking there may come along a reason beyond the coercion of a high school English teacher for me to stop pretending to have read something. But with the passing of each increment of 5yr reunions, I seem to require an increased action potential to cross the threshold of just saying Kafkaesque to sound cool."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 7, 2020","2. If you'd like to know what one means by “Kafkaesque” (according to the above article ""to denote a sense of suddenly inhabiting a world in which one’s customary habits of thought and behaviour are confounded and made hopeless"")"
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 20, 2021","I think he suffered from identity crisis and felt like a misfit within the walls of his own house. So he has envisaged himself as a vermin that is neglected and loathed by his family. Now that explains his insect theory and the origin of the term Kafkaesque. One must have background knowledge of his life, in order to enjoy his writing. I don't want to give away the ending but the whole reading experience was rather disturbing"
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 1, 2022",The KAFKAESQUE plot shows us that maybe one cannot control the uneventful; one can always adapt and survive and go on.
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 16, 2023","This was deemed a classic from 1916, and I’d heard the term kafkaesque so had to cover this one finally as it wasn’t mandatory high school lit in my semi-Brit education filled with Shakespeare."
The Metamorphosis,2,"January 28, 2020","- Gregor is the quintessential kafkaesque antihero: worked himself to utter exhaustion to pay off his parent's debt (even though they have a maid at home). Only himself to blame for the wretchedness of the situation, accepting it all of his life, like others of Kafka's doomed protagonists."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 26, 2020","Okay! What a weird novella. I had to read this for my World Masterpieces class and this masterpiece comes from 1915 Austria-Hungary (now The Czech Republic). This is a novella by 20th century author Franz Kafka called The Metamorphosis in which we meet young traveling salesman Gregor who one morning finds himself transformed into an insect of some sort. There’s many translations about what he’s turned into the one I read he was a cockroach. So we’ll stick with insect for this review. With only 3 parts that are each about 22 pages (at least in the textbook that I read) the novella is so short. Frank Kafka wrote such weird content that gave readers such a weird feeling that scholars made a word just for his stories or stories like his... Kafkaesque. And this story for sure gave me a weird feeling when I was reading it. Not scary just super weird and unnerving. The descriptions of Gregor skirting around the apartment as a bug were so intense and detailed and it irked me ever so slightly. It’s a great story to read for this spooky season it’s just not scary. But it was really good and explored the problems facing the new modern world of 1900. The first thing Gregor thinks after waking up is how he will get to work. It’s just so absurd that someone would think like that but it’s part of the commentary and the absurdity of Kafka style stories. I would for sure recommend this novella and exploring what Kafkaesque really means because it’s super interesting. Anyway, I’m giving this a 9/10 (4.5/5 stars) in this short review for a short book. It’s super weird but a super fun read!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 20, 2021","A short book that gives us the whole experience of reading Kafka. The book goes straight to the point in his opening sentence: ""One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug"". As it happens in every Kafka's book, there is a feeling of anguish, hopelessness and despair. The book has several interpretations. Mine, in particular, is that Gregor's metamorphosis serves as a tipping point. It shows that Gregor's family life was already in a very precarious balance and Gregor's metamorphosis was only the catalyst for other metamorphoses, particularly the intra-family relationships. I recommend this book as the gateway to the Kafkaesque world."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 8, 2023","Before I started with the book, I had read in multiple places that Kafka excels at fusing fantasticism and realism. And the proof of the pudding was indeed in the eating. The elements following the ludicrous (or should I take this opportunity to use 'Kafkaesque') premise couldn't have been any more earthly. Soon it stops occurring to you how impossible the premise is."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 6, 2025","This violin scene man. I feel like, at least for my reading, everything amounted to that. This was the first cathartic expression Gregor actually takes himself seriously on. He lets himself get kicked around, mortally wounded, treated like an animal; this is the only time he genuinely expresses what he wants. This expression of emotion, however, is pure selflessness. In the ideal confession, Gregor wouldn't have to keep his sister captive in his room. She would stay there forever out of her own passion. This description of Gregor's perception of his sister genuinely stole a couple tears from my eyes. Oh my gosh dude it's so precious and delicate and beautiful and heartbreaking. You can hear the violin being played through the pages; you can feel Gregor's needs and hunger getting nourished listening to this beautiful melody; you can smell the rotting apple stuck in Gregor's back; you can see the insect pathetically using all its might to turn away from its family who immediately reject everything he is by a mere glance at him; every sense in activated in this climax. Not only is this a testament to how perfect Kafka is as a writer, it's an entirely new level of immersion that DESERVES its own word; thankfully, it has one: Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 7, 2020","Now coming to Metamorphosis. There are various explanations, analysis of the story. And the book leaves the scholars and readers equally perplexed. That's the essence of 'Kafkaesque' fiction."
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 29, 2020","I've always been curious of Kafka's works. At some point, I wanted to use the word Kafkaesque knowing that I have a complete idea of what it means. Now that I've read my first Kafka book, I realize why Kafka is such a renowned name in literature."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 20, 2023",The protagonist Gregor gets transformed into a vermin overnight. This process completely disconnects his body and mind. His bodily needs are of an insect whereas the mind of a human which is in coherence with the thought process of the reader. The author doesn’t give explanation for the sudden transformation. One can perceive the absurdity of existence and the incomprehensibility of bureaucratic power. An individual is pulled into “Kafkaesque” situation and tries to cope up with the sudden changes and chaotic nature of life and mounds himself and gets better with it.
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 17, 2019","The story is an absurdist tragedy, where the circumstances are Kafkaesque, and the reactions of the characters of the story to their absurd circumstances are very real. From the moment Gregor wakes up as a bug to the frustrations of the Samsa family living in these certainly strange conditions the characters seems oddly somewhat real people stuck in surreal circumstances. You can blame the Samsa as much as you can the tragedy that befalls them."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 7, 2021","METAMORPHOSIS BY FRANZ KAFKA was my first book by him, though I have read quotes and stories of his and about him before, which led to my interest of reading his works. Also, since I really love Japanese literature, so he bringing out the Kafkaesque effect in the writings, was more than enough for me, to dive right into his works."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 1, 2024",Kafkaesque philosophy being highlighted in the fact Gregor Samsa awoke one day to be surprised with the absurd reality of himself being turned into a giant bug yet his only reflection upon it being how he’ll get to work on time
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 28, 2025","I found myself spiraling down a late-night rabbit hole, researching Kafka’s life and the intent behind his work. The concept of the Kafkaesque often refers to the bureaucratic nature of capitalistic and government systems.The sort of complex unclear processes in which no one individual ever really has a comprehensive grasp on what is going on. Kafka’s confrontation with the absurd captures this existential crisis, if you will."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 14, 2025","okay wait guys i’m a little dumb, and i don’t fully understand the metaphor(phasis)(haha, i’m so funny), but i am not taking stars off because of that! one of my least favorite things that people do when they criticize art is saying “it was too confusing”, “i didn’t get it”. i feel as if that means that you are giving up on the puzzle that the artist has given you!!! you’re not done consuming!! when you stop at that comment, “i just didn’t get it”, you end up with a person with the worst takes ever and one of the leading causes of the death of metaphor! (i.e. most of the criticisms of Poor Things. my favorite book… don’t play.) let a piece challenge you, let it rack your brain, let it give you a headache! let it consume you! that being said, i get it. but i didn’t fully. my philosophical brain is yet to fully develop, unfortunately. i was hoping this text would help me understand the term “kafkaesque” beyond my usage of only using it when i see something about turning into a bug, haha. (*spoiler* like in gregg arakis film, Nowhere. (one of my favorite movies ever))— without having to google it. i think i will have to read more of his writings to get it! or, ask some of my more-philosophical friends. additionally, i will DEFINITELY have to discuss this for my english degree, so i will fully get it one day. in conclusion: justice for my boy, gregor 💔"
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 27, 2017","EDIT (SPOILERS): Following my reading a couple of essays on the ""Kafkaesque"", my perspective of the book has changed albeit not from ""good to bad"" or vice versa, rather I acknowledge that this novel has more depth than I had attributed to it previously.Ableism is inherent in this novel and evidently so, however, a subliminal yet not less significant influence upon this text is Freudian psychology. Freudian influence is evident through the portrayal of guilt and cognitive repression- in technical terms, Freud referred to this as the ""superego"". The superego in The Metamorphosis hence is undeniably symbolically represented through the characterisation of Gregor's father as he noted that his lack of esteem is due to his fathers' attitudes. Gregor's transformation to the insect thus must be representative of is entering into this unconscious world where repressed desires are held; the transformation is the symbolic escape from the superego, or in this case, Gregor's father. The conclusion of the novel further establishes the dominating nature of the superego and the conscious world over the unconscious. Conclusively, this book is remarkable in its entirety- from the inclusion of such intricate concepts, Kafka's subtle writing style, and the shortness of the text, this book is undeniable brilliance."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 25, 2018","Man, that's kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 29, 2019","Having been ignorant to the impact Kafka has had on so many authors, i fell in love with books by Haruki Murakami, one of which is entitled ""Kafka on the Shore"". Murakami was strongly influenced by Kafaka. [And of course we all hear the saying ""kafkaesque; though, I went on my merrily way ignoring that term]. Reading about Murakami and the impact Kafka had on him as an author, well.... i took the plunge."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 1, 2020","What makes the story nightmarish is that, although Gregor Samsa(The Protagonist)finds himself turned into an insect, he still remains human and Kafka walks us through his internal monologue;the helplessness and pain that he goes through when his loved ones don't consider him to be human anymore,but he still is, and he wants to scream that to them, hug them and cry with them but he can't.No amount of philosophical rambling about human despondency and loneliness-that many people feel-can stir such kind of reactions from the readers as Kafka does with Metamorphosis.And the most absurd thing about this story is that, at the end, the protagonist doesn't jump out of his bed relieved from a bad dream.It's not a dream,but real and that makes it truly Kafkaesque"

The Metamorphosis,4,"July 13, 2025","Kafka’s writing is oddly simple but leaves so much room for interpretation. It’s not overly flowery or deep but it makes you feel uneasy (in a good way). I get now why people say ‘Kafkaesque.’ It’s not just the weirdness, but it’s the horror of being misunderstood, unwanted and slowly forgotten. You can read it as a metaphor for burnout, mental illness or just the absurdity of life or whatever. There’s no one way to see it. You finish the book and it just lingers in your head and making you question what in the world it all meant."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 26, 2020","This is my first time reading Kafka and within the first few sentences, I'm struck by how simple yet confident his writing style is. He has nothing to hide behind verbose prose - his storytelling and ideas speak for themselves. Metamorphosis sparked discomfort in a way that made me want to laugh while crawling out of my own skin. Kafka chronicles the positive feedback loop of Gregor's dehumanization and his family's growing (and understandable) resentment of him. As much as the bug metamorphosis is characteristically grotesque, it feels as if we can see a bit of ourselves in Gregor's transformation and successive plight. This fantastical tale feels oddly banal. Gregor's first worries a bug-man are not about his new exoskeleton, but instead about his tardiness to work. Equally as interesting, Kafka pays close attention to the family's adaptation to living with a bug, metamorphosing from dependents relying on Gregor's breadwinning to caregivers serving his needs. All in all, the story has helped me understand the meaning of Kafkaesque - specific in mundane details but blurry and uneasy in meaning."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 4, 2023","All jokes aside, this is my first Kafka read and having read a bit about Kafkaesque literature, this novel checks all the boxes. There is an existential exploration of the value of humans in a modern capitalist world, in which your production and its value makes or breaks you. As the protagonist acknowledges his body was turned into a literal insect, his only concern is making it to the office on time because despite his perfect record, his boss would never believe him if he called in sick."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 22, 2024","4. Learning about the term""Kafkaesque"" has been interesting and I'm glad to have finally read the actual text. I once read the summary of it for an assignment on absurdism and I did NOT vibe with the story but as I keep finding out again and again, you never know how you feel about a book until you take the time to actually read it."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 2, 2024","This novel is a clear example of the surrealism present in the writings of the author (from whose surname comes the term ""kafkaesque""), since it describes a situation that is disturbing due to its absurdity, but that ultimately reveals the most terrifying details of reality."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 27, 2024",The other short stories in this edition were as intriguing and a perfect introduction to the Kafkaesque literature.
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 31, 2018",Only after reading this book you can really grasp the meaning of kafkaesque.

The Metamorphosis,2,"June 21, 2021","Snagged this a few months ago for free on Kindle but never really had the motivation to prioritize it over any other book. After hearing three different people discuss something being “Kafkaesque” in one week, I decided that it was fate and gave it a go."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 28, 2023",uhhh i “read” an audiobook and followed the screen to “read” this book so ofc my understanding will be a little crappy but i think i understand what “kafkaesque” means. yay??

The Metamorphosis,4,"March 12, 2025","I have to admit that I have never read any Kafka stories. This was my first. However, after Fable’s wrap summary for 2024 describing my shelf to be “a Kafkaesque maze” I was intrigued to read his work. And, it did not disappoint."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 10, 2021","He then lost his job, no income just savings. The family having difficult time not just because financially but the primary awful situation that has happened to Gregor. His lovely sister, Greta, attempt her family to adapt, but in the end she also bursting the words to caused abandoned him. Such a poor Gregor till the end. In this part, despite of the 'dark', you'll get the point what's mean to be in the Kafkaesque situation."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 18, 2022","This took me weeks to complete and to finally compose a review. The Metamorphosis is a magical realism world of Gregor Samsa, an overworked protagonist of Kafka's work. Gregor basically acts and thinks the same way, both as a human and as a bug. He was kafkaesque (cool word!) in which he did nothing to change his previous horrible state as a salesman. He chose not to change. This goes on until he miraculously found himself as a bug one morning. Ever since that happened, everything changes. Though Gregor wouldn't accept that fact. Imagine still worrying about work!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 6, 2022","I cried a considerable amount of tears while being frustrated with how people around him were so harsh. The reason behind me reading this is because I have watched ""The Fly"" by David Cronenberg, it is a Kafkaesque film. When I read the first few pages, I was shocked and confused even a little frustrated. I knew what I am getting into, I know little about the synopsis of the story, and how Kafkaesque works but it was still difficult to push aside the questions and just read."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 23, 2022","The book is a mockery upon the roots on which several of our very important institutions such as family life, career, attachments etc are based. The reader is left utterly shocked as to how baseless these most cherished and cared for things in life are. One change in your anatomy and it won't be long before all affection and love and respect would vanish in thin air from the minds of those who you call your beloved. I would call it amongst the most powerful ridicule on the face of social conditioning that drives the men and women of the world since ages. We attach ourselves with surface of what a person is and as long as that is polished it doesn't matter if the insides are trashy. Our relationships thrive on the images of what a good brother or a son should look like and if that image is not met then we don't have the eyes to look deeper. Overall the book is a very kafkaesque experience is the most of what one can say ... !"
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 21, 2023","I had heard very good reviews of this work by Kafka and I really liked it a lot, the story has a strange vibe and can make you feel bad and uncomfortable as you read; however, the reading feels quite fast, fluid and digestible. It's the first work I've read by Kafka, and I have a feeling that the Kafkaesque type of character is the type of character I'm curious to know more about."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2023","I couldn’t tell you why Kafka wrote such a bizarre, grotesque story but I can tell you that this is why ‘Kafkaesque’ refers to something that is absurd. Gregor Samsa, an overworked salesman, awakens one day to find himself transformed into a Dung Beetle. At first I thought he must be dreaming, but no, his manager and family freak out and essentially cordon him off into his room. He is gradually scorned by his loved ones and lives a pitiable existence. While it is open to numerous interpretations, one way in which I interpreted it was as a commentary on how the pressures of society to work constantly can morph one into something unrecognizable and be extremely alienating. When Gregor finds himself “ill” and unable to contribute to the financial stability of his household or his company, he is suddenly viewed as worthless. As I said, I have no idea if I’m even close but this is certainly a short read that will give you plenty of food for thought."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 1, 2024","In a Kafkaesque world of silence and isolation, The Metamorphosis is brilliantly quiet. I do wish I could have felt Gregor's pain and suffering in greater detail. His oppression and experience is actually quite realistic, and portrays a feeling of frustration no greater words could explain apart from that one scene in Interstellar. I really loved the body horror of the book and Gregor's descent into despair. It wasn't superstitious-fictitious, it was real. The ghosts in our stories don't need to be lurking in the shadows or be unknown to us, they can be the very things around us. They don't need to be explained in great detail, they could appear out of the blue. They don't need to build to a climax and a jump-scare, they could just send us into the black. To cope with this fear, we forget. We forget our ghosts, we forget bloody Mary at the dead of night, we forget that there is any boogeyman, and in the process, forget ourselves too."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 1, 2024","Unsettling, poignant, and beautifully written. While the story's metaphor as a whole is pretty opaque, a part of me wonders if that's the point—if Kafka was openly exploring certain ambiguities that all writers have to deal with at some level, that allow different readers to take away different things. (Gregor's transformation struck me as a possible representation of mental health struggles, but I have a feeling that that's more of a personal comparison rather than a serious interpretation.) But what does stand out for sure is that Kafka writes with a great deal of emotional intelligence—both Gregor's POV and the depiction of his family were handled with sensitivity and nuance. When most people say ""Kafkaesque"" it means grotesque, and while The Metamorphosis is definitely that, it's much more. I initially picked this up because of its significance in Western civ but didn't fully understand why it was a big deal; now I'm super excited to dig into more of Kafka's works."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 14, 2025","Short lil read, really enjoyed the Bernofsky translation at times. Really been thinking about the word “saccharine” and the sentence “I have always known you as a calm, sensible person, and now it seems you’ve begun to permit yourself to the most whimsical extravagances.” I like reading another person’s marked up copy so I can’t see the rubbish they find value in. One person’s trash is another’s treasure. Wasn’t as gory as “kafkaesque” has been made to sound in my life leading up to this read. I understand it’s a classic but it wasn’t amazing..? Like where the wow factor. Also, such a hard story to explain to someone: “So this son is the breadwinner for his family of 4 and one day wakes up as this bug and uproots the life of his family and he’s forced to live in his room as a bug crawling about the room while his sister brings him food and his parents avoid him. Eventually, he realizes the struggle he’s caused in his family and starves himself?” Like bro"

The Metamorphosis,4,"May 13, 2019","I didn’t read this exact version, but overall I like Kafka’s writing style, and so I liked this short story. I found the ending to be particularly intriguing: the revelation of, what I believe to be, Kafka’s true intended focus of the “metamorphosis.” I wouldn’t recommend it for pleasure-readers(?) as it may be misunderstood as dark and as having a garbage plot. This is a work of literature carrying a sophisticated, original philosophy and style found only in Kafka’s works and can only be imitated and coined “Kafkaesque” by others. I don’t think it was so much concerned with having a plot than it was with expressing a reflection of Kafka’s life or providing a response to similar literature written in his time. Personally wasn’t my taste, but he’s an amazing writer—I have to hand that to him. Literature lovers will find it interesting, and academics, well, even more so!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 4, 2020","“The blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""Kafkaesque””"
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 3, 2020","Metamorphosis introduces Kafka's world view. It is here we find full germination of what is called as 'kafkaesque' - a sudden circumstance where your existence, meaning, hopes have become meaningless."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 30, 2022","Ironically, a 40 page book could easily merit my longest review. Before I give my thoughts, I’ll acknowledge that the writing itself is not super rich. Much of the book is simply telling you what happens, and I felt that it lacked sensory details (somewhat depends on your translation.) This isn’t really a problem though, because the philosophical themes are the reason for its fame. If not for these deeper interpretations, I could tell you the entire plot in a sentence: Gregor Samsa wakes up a bug for no reason, his family cares for him reluctantly, he dies. With that being said, The Metamorphosis is a perfect example of Kafkaesque, and its eccentricity gives it its charm. You could read this book 30 times and get something completely different each time or you could read it once and get nothing. All in all, it was a short, good read and I would recommend it."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 27, 2023",Does a work by Kafka count as Kafkaesque?
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 29, 2023","I do in fact keep thinking about this novella so I guess that's a positive. Also, I understand there will be people who say I just ""didn't get it"" because of existentialism and how that is the style of the genre. I know its the style, I've read a couple in it, but I still wouldn't prefer this one. Either way, thank you Franz for inspiring people to make the word Kafkaesque its my fav &lt;3."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 7, 2023","Finished the Susan Bernofsky translation this morning ... I really appreciated that in the afterword she discussed Kafka's intention of a metaphor at play. I admit that while I read I couldn't help think about the looming metaphor of a family member who's falling apart before his family's very eyes via addiction or depression. But in this case, which is both funny and sad to me at the moment, from being some sort of salesman ""creature."" Maybe a workaholic, which is also related to addiction issues from what I understand. I'd also like to share that when I searched for Kafka on Google to learn something about his personal philosophy, I learned that he is something of an ""absurdist"" and that ""kafkaesque"" means absurd. He thought that humanity or the world as we know was the result of God having a bad day. He died at either 40 or 41 of tuberculosis, starving to death."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 12, 2023","I can really understand the idea of ""Kafkaesque"" after reading this novella. The mix of boring, dry reality with the strange and fantastical is woven together so seamlessly and done in a way that never lets go of the tone of the book."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 27, 2023","Now comes Kafka, from childhood to adulthood, always repressed by some sort of higher power in the society, whether its his father or some higher bureaucracrat official.. which is reflected in not just his literature but also in his personality and face.. along with a feeling of guilt and shame, reluctance and shyness, oppression and reticence.. to an extent that there's a terminology know as 'Kafkaesque'!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 31, 2023","I really enjoyed this. I tend to gravitate towards the more bleak and miserable. And having had a peak into 'kafkaesque' writing, I would like to check out The Trials, sometime."

The Metamorphosis,4,"December 11, 2023",I really enjoyed the style Kafka writes in and many movies I like can be described in part as Kafkaesque. So I appreciate Kafka's influence probably more than his work directly.
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2024","Gregor Samsa awakes in his bed as a beetle, lives without control of himself, and dies. His family are grateful for his death. The story is, obviously, kafkaesque - confusing, with little exposition, and even less explanation. We never learn why Samsa is transformed, in this contributes to the cruelty of his powerlessness. Like The Trial, Metamorphosis depicts a man divorced from control - and it is perhaps this that is a reference to our own condition. Of course, I could be reading into it. But Kafka’s depiction of Gregor trapped in work before the story’s beginning perhaps points to an idea that Samsa is equally unfree before his condition. There is also much to be said about Grete, who ends the story; Gregor is a kind of sacrifice so that his sister may be viewed as a woman by their parents."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 10, 2020","‘Kafkaesque’ is truly a separate term unto itself. To understand it’s meaning, this short read is a good path. Despair without hope is how I’d fashion it, but there’s also acceptance, servility, and dark humour involved."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 16, 2020","Apart from the thriller that a moth can provide, the story is completely folded into a philosophy that truly can be termed Kafkaesque. I personally came closer to the story as the protagonist is torn off of his family and a being completely left on his own is produced. This product, at first, is a passive output of a society completely relentless towards such a creature that it, ironically, expects to witness here and there. Only towards the end is Gregor self-reliant and self-reflecting which makes his otherwise helpless passivity into an active prodding. Does he not act at all? Is he acted upon hy his family and the lodgers? What amounts to action in a society wherein one must be considering one's daily business even when one rises as a bug?"
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 9, 2020","Altogether, this is a novella heavy on symbolisms and it would be a bit difficult for everyone to digest. There is a reason that the word 'Kafkaesque' is now an adjective in English."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 12, 2020","Kinda reminds me of Ovid's Metamorphoses, but in a more depressing tone, understanding that this is the context that Kafka came from. I understand how the novella seems quite flat and mundane (hence, ""Kafkaesque""), but it's still worth close reading. My favourite close-read was realising how Gregor's transformation seems like a metaphor of the consequences of capitalism and a bureaucratic society, and what's really ironic was in the very first part of the book where Gregor, knowing he already transformed, worries that he'll get to work on time. His transformation led to a spiral of his own unfortunate events, and eventually to his death."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 17, 2022","A phenomenon that is Kafkaesque, is when you struggle and fight with all you can but the other force is too massive for you to conquer it."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 4, 2023","This is a very brief novel that can be read in a few hours and still carries every bit of the Kafkaesque feeling of The Trial. A man turned into a bug and then rejected by his family is an interesting plot for sure, but drives you to wonder a big fat ""WHY?"" the whole time. I think that is another mark of uniqueness that distinguishes Kafka is how you'll be driven to doing many googles and reading of theories on interpretations for what the heck was going on in this story. Often with him, it's the period of his life and what was going on then that can help explain some of it, but it still remains a huge mystery overall, which is just what keeps me coming back to read more of his work. Highly recommend for a quick exposure to Kafka."
The Metamorphosis,2,"December 22, 2023","And yeah that’s the point, the emptiness and visceral shock factor of Kafkaesque media but damn!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 1, 2024","We've all seen the memes around this story, so I decided it was time to give it a read! It's a weird one, but in the best possible way! I've never read anything else by this author before, but I think I understand now what people mean when they describe certain grotesque things as Kafkaesque. I'm honestly intrigued and I might have to look into reading more Kafka, even if only to enjoy the atmosphere again. And what an atmosphere it was! There was a sense of creeping (A lot of slow creeping, to be honest) dread all through the story that gave me goosebumps, a thing no other book has ever managed to do! I'm thoroughly impressed!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 12, 2024","Interesting story to say the least. Very kafkaesque, which is to be expected. I dont think that the book is about Gregor at all in a sense. Rather that he is used as the catalyst in illustrating how a family can deteriorate in a hopeless situation, but told through Gregors perspective. Sure he was allso in a verry helpless situation but I felt that the focus was more on the family as a whole rather than Gregor and his helpless predicament. You can almost draw likeness to a family with a sick and bedridden familymember and how that can affect the family as a whole, especially when the sick family member is not like them self. Even The ""libration"" and ""relief"" of that built up resentment, in a fucked up way, is felt when the Samsa family can move on after Gregors death."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 21, 2025","Jokes aside, it starts out funny, but ends up depressing - a true Kafkaesque piece of work. Gregor Samsa, a young man stuck in a boring, tiring salesman job wakes up one morning and finds out he's a cockroach,'Devil take it!'."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 18, 2017","7/17/17 The Metamorphosis by Kafka - I read through this short piece from 1915. Imagine going to bed at night as a traveling salesman trying to support his family and waking as a horrible vermin, an insect. It's creepy and embarrassing and really really weird, and it's what happens to Gregor Samsa in this famous novella that helps the reader understand that Kafkaesque means oppressive and nightmarish. So read between the lines. Think in metaphor. Consider the place, time and political circumstances in which this very short book was written. There's a Schmoop with three possible interpretations."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 12, 2018",It's so Kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 22, 2019","One of those books you're supposed to read at some point in your life, so when I found a bargain copy I felt I had reached that point. I'll give it four stars, not because I was enthralled with the book and can't stop talking about it--that didn't happen. Rather I appreciated the book for its simplicity. The term ""Kafkaesque"" can seem awfully pretentious even when used correctly, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this book so thoroughly unpretentious. A man changes into a large beetle, immediately altering his life and the lives of his family. That's it, that's the story. It's both horrific and mundane, but it's also short. Good stuff."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 25, 2020","To say, this book is amazing will be an understatement. I'm out for words. As the story progresses, you get to know more about humans, more about society and their relationship. This book has many many layers. To enjoy the book, you ought to read between the lines. My first Kafka read and I must say it is truly Kafkaesque. Kafka was nothing short of a genius and it is heavily unfortunate that he couldn't get to know about his abilities while he was alive and he left us in such a short amount of time. Whether it's cheap or costly doesn't matter, just read the book coz if you judge by content, it's absolutely priceless."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 1, 2021","Franz Kafka famous for the absurd situations in his writing and showing through his work the sufferings of an average office worker due to which the word Kafkaesque is coined was indeed a great artist. He has perfectly shown in his story Metamorphosis that even after being transformed into a vermin the protagonist was worried that he was late at work, so was the effect of race to earn money. That how his family also started to think of him as a liability now that he wasn't in his normal form. A very interesting story with many hidden references, I really liked it."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 9, 2021","A Kafkaesque work about Gregor Samsa who wakes up one day and discovers that he has turned into a giant insect. It's unnecessarily complicated; we don't know the reasons behind Gregor's transformation into a vermin. And instead of being utterly shocked by his appearance, Gregor contemplates the fact that he's late for work for work and whether he would catch the next train."
The Metamorphosis,1,"November 13, 2021","This story is to say the least, Kafkaesque, according to my English teacher. We read about Kafka’s childhood and background a bit... and it was, again, bizarre. Everything about this book is just super weird. From the interactions, writing style, and to the actual plot."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 29, 2022","In the end though, I decided on four stars. I guess Kafkaesque is part of our modern vocabulary due to books like this so it seems it worth reading just for that. At least now I have a sense for kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,2,"August 11, 2022",a country doctor was just so so. where’s the imagery and excessive description and depression to make it kafkaesque?!
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 20, 2023","Great book especially towards the end where Gregor’s family finally has a break in which the text flexes the tiredness of sympathy and the expression of music as a means of Gregor trying to reach out and show he has humanity (which he does, and the terrible twist of the book is that his family is too tired to care even when he dies and want to return to their monotony). I just felt as if there were some overly saturated notions in the book that made the overall theme kind of messy, even though in a retrospective away from the book, this noisiness in the book paved the “Kafkaesque” thematic styling we see him illustrate in his novels as well as heavily in the novels of Camus and Murakami."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 1, 2023",The Metamorphosis was my introduction to Franz Kafka. The unique story and Kafkaesque style hooked me immediately and I finished the book in 2 days. This was made easier by its incredibly short length of around 55 pages (according to my copy). Although - despite its short nature - I still found myself attached to the main character.
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 10, 2023","These layers of helplessness and confusion hit you, with each realization of absurdity making you feel more lost in the depth of Kafkaesque sadness."
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 30, 2024","It was my first book by Kafka. I'm not convinced I'll want to read more of his; this book was definitely on the gloomy side. But I at least now understand the word ""Kafkaesque"" better."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 2, 2024","After falling victim to the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon and hearing the term Kafkaesque everywhere I turned, I decided it was time to dive into an FK novella."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 14, 2025","I thought no one could beat Dostoevsky, but Kafka didn't disappoint me. It is high time to become a Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,2,"June 23, 2018","Not as interesting as I thought it would be. I guess I hyped it up with the idea that he must be a big deal if his work was so unique that ""Kafkaesque"" is used to describe something similar to his work. I probably did not understand all of the meaning behind it, but I am okay with that. I would rather read a story where I did not understand all of the author's intentions and still enjoyed the story rather than conversely. I wish I enjoyed the story for the story's sake a little more with this one."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 23, 2018","I felt weird while reading this book - or I should say Kafkaesque. It is not one of those books with gruesome depictions or gory turnout of events; it, although with simple narrative, instills an uneasy feeling of a person's life -closely related to Kafka himself - his struggles, his relationship with his family, and his helplessness to rescript his fate."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 1, 2018","Kafka's works and notably ""The Metamorphosis"" reminds us that by fine-tuning our attention to the absurd, in this modern industrial age, we can create the world that we want to live in, not the one in which we found our selves. The pressures that we surrender ourselves to, can shape our goals and put us in a Kafkaesque world, where the only needs we end lives to remedy are others' needs. Those others that, in contrast, give a cold shoulder to us in a ""metamorphosis"" situation."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 24, 2020","Metamorphosis is not your usual dose of philosophical literature, but is esoteric and critical in its own sense. I think it helps truly grasp the context of the term ""Kafkaesque"" more than anything else."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 21, 2020",After reading this classic I am realizing that probably classics aren't my cup of tea. Before reading the book I read about the book and came to know how how the literary style is called kafkaesque and is one of the seminal work of 20th century. But somehow in anticipation of something revolutionary but the revolution passed by me.
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 31, 2020","The Metamorphosis was my first Kafka reading and I can say that it is a suitable work to start reading Kafka with, not long, confusing nor complex. Besides, the absurd beginning, the nightmarish aura throughout the novella, and the theme of loss of identity make a good introduction to the term ""Kafkaesque"", which define such surrealist, complex, extraordinary dire situations in the works by Kafka and the later works he inspired."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 20, 2020","A deeply depressing and harrowing story that gets to the point right from the first line, with absolutely no sign of hesitation. The deliberately normalized way of dealing with the metaphorical and nightmarish situations throughout the novel was unsettling for me, only to realize later that at some point, I got used to the Kafkaesque world. At the end, I could not help but think about the contemplation and inner struggles of the author, while penning down this novella."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 1, 2020",One word : kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 24, 2020","This book is not for everyone, especially and only for people with pure hearts and good intentions because others won't be able to relate to Kafkaesque style of writing. Sparing the details of characters and their lives. Kafka somehow poured his heart into this work of fiction with an underlying statement that no one would stick around if you become invaluable. Not even family. Maybe, it can't be generalized but there is humongous level of truth and honesty to it. A subtly written, heartbreaking experience."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 9, 2021","This was a weird one. I've never read anything else by this other before, but I think I understand now what people mean when they describe certain grotesque things as Kafkaesque. I'm honestly intrigued and I might have to look into reading more Kafka, even if only to enjoy the atmosphere again. And what an atmosphere it was! There was a sense of creeping (A lot of slow creeping, to be honest) dread all through the story that gave me goosebumps, a thing no other book has ever managed to do! I'm thoroughly impressed!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 10, 2021","“the blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""kafkaesque”"
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 12, 2021","One of the greatest stories to come out of Modern literature. The novella reflects the anxieties of many major events such as World War One and is semi-autobiographical of Kafka’s family dynamic. Metamorphosis explores themes of alienation, identity, and compassion and draws on the philosophical idea of the absurd. The story is a key example of Kafka’s bleak and morbid writing style reflected in his writing and pioneered the term ‘Kafkaesque’ in mainstream culture. A read for anyone, specifically those with an interest in Modernist literature, or wish to explore the world of Kafka."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 13, 2021","Mungkin sudah jalannya aku magang jadi orang content. Beberapa hari lalu diberi tugas menulis artikel tentang kenapa The Metamorphosis-nya Franz Kafka termasuk karya klasik. Duh, aku belum baca. Akhirnya aku pergi ke Twitter dan tanya-tanya. Setelah baca karyanya, baca artikel Eka Kurniawan tentang G. Samsa juga cover bukunya, dan video-video tentang Kafkaesque aku jadi paham kenapa karya Kafka termasuk klasik. Sekarang, ngeliat kecoa atau serangga-serangga berkaki banyak nggakan sama lagi..."
The Metamorphosis,3,"February 17, 2022","very strange, very textbook kafkaesque surrealism (ie i see where murakami draws his inspiration)"
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 28, 2022","Reading this was a very uncomfortable experience. I took from it less the commentary on absurdity, isolation or capitalism, I kinda just like how weird it felt to read. Kafka creates this eerie ambience about his books that I can't describe as anything but significant and powerful. Anyways yeah I can't really put into words why I liked it so much, I guess I just like how gloomy it made me feel and it reminds me of this painting I have opposite my room of a town/village thats only painted in cool blues that I've always thought of as ""kafkaesque"""
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 28, 2022",the one thing that makes me so inexplicably bound to this book is the question it raises of an inauthentic existence in the absence of normalcy..gregor enlightens us on what it is meant to be - in the most primitive sense. does his metamorphosis into the vermin creature cause a break in who he is? was his life as a salesman ever even who he really was? or perhaps he was nothing and is nothing and forever will remain nothing? the metamorphosis is existentialism at its finest and i highly doubt that it will escape my thoughts..kafkaesque absurdity is my favourite genre of everything.
The Metamorphosis,1,"January 28, 2023","Good news: I can now say ""Kafkaesque"" with impunity."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 6, 2023","Being a huge fan of Playboi Carti and of depressing stories of hopelessness, reading Metamorphosis was a must. Plus, I have used the term Kafkaesque much too often for someone whose not read his work."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"August 13, 2023",genuinely sort of wholesome at times? like sure it’s kafkaesque and all but idk I was expecting it to be alienating and depressing and I guess it is a little but yknow he lasts a fair amount of time as a bug he gets fed and when he dies he does so being like yea I mean I would rather them remember me as the human who provided for them anyway. maybe I’m an idiot or maybe my baseline for harrowing media is skewed by just having read watchmen but idk it was good I liked it nice short length
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 29, 2023","This book is the first kafka book i read, i have to admit i didn't appreciate this literature until now that i started writing my opinion on it, and what a dark depressing entrance was to kafka's work hence the description "" Kafkaesque"""
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 27, 2023",This was not a usual genre for me( and I listened to it being read) But trying to push myself.I read about Kafka and what his writing signifies ( as in Kafkaesque) which gave me another layer of understanding.
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 27, 2023","Although there are some light-er hearted pieces, as a whole however the writing is quite dark and disturbing or as they call 'Kafkaesque'. His writing is confronting, surreal and ominous and rightfully so (Spoilers?) I just wanted to hug my pet cat that doesn't exist after reading some certain stories. Solid book, I didn't like the one page mini-stories. Felt like a throwaway just put into the book."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 13, 2024","Typical kafkaesque novel, in the sense abstractions are used to convey deeper meanings. Lessons i ve taken away"
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 7, 2024","Although read in translation, it's almost impossible not to appreciate the narrative technique of Kafka. Even without explicitly taking any particular sides of the characters mentioned in the story, the message was clear. It's heartbreaking when one's loved ones, the ones one live and work so hard for, do not at all bother to take care of the individual when found in an annoyingly invalid state. Absurdist and Existentialist in essence, the Metamorphosis indeed epitomizes the brutal truths about Humanity in a classic Kafkaesque manner. An absolute must read for all."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 30, 2024","Overall, yay I can say Kafkaesque now."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 9, 2025","A staple of 20th literature, which I certainly won’t forget for a while. I found this short story to be rather disturbing, but has allowed me to fully appreciate the concept of ‘Kafkaesque’. Throughout its absurdity there is almost something comical - the situation Gregor is placed in is so wildly strange it is difficult to imagine, yet at the same time, his loneliness and isolation is something that we all feel as human beings. So, in this sense, it’s paradoxically concludes the notion of loneliness and marginalisation."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 17, 2025","Now I know what it means when people say something is “Kafkaesque.” I never read his work before. This was my first, but I did enjoy it."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 17, 2025","Kafka doesn’t give answers, but he’s brilliant at making you sit with uncomfortable questions. It’s bleak, strange, and at times frustrating — exactly what “Kafkaesque” is all about. This book isn’t pleasant, but it sticks with you."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 25, 2017","A true ""Kafkaesque"" story."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 21, 2019","Probably one of the most shocking stories I've ever heard of, Kafka's tell of despair is something unnerving and quite painful, nonetheless remains as an open box full of surprises for every reader, I personally find it very dark and depressing, but at the same time very real and unique, I can understand now how the adjective Kafkaesque has come to be after all, a nightmarish atmospheric situation, very hard to explain but very easy to understand."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 21, 2019","Kafkaesque writing which is named after the bizarre writing style Franz is quite unique in his storytelling. I enjoyed his alien-like creature and the descriptions are at times downright frightening. If you like sci-fi this is a great classic book of the genre, yet it is more than that. It has inspired many movies and other writers. I am not a fan of sci-fi, but I am really glad I finally read this on my book bucket list."
The Metamorphosis,3,"February 4, 2020","I had seen, for most of my reading life, references to something being ""kafkaesque"", and even though I'd never read any of his work, I always had a pretty good idea what it meant just by the context it may have been mentioned in. This is short, easy read, and indeed gives the reader a good idea of just what ""kafkaesque"" means, so I'm glad I read it. I'll be reading more of his work as time goes on."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 27, 2020","I'm guessing there are several layers to this book. Well, all works of a disturbed mind are ones to be valued. I interpreted the ""metamorphosis"" as not of the physical realm, but of the mental one. I might be floating several layers above the surface, and would require more than a few readings to go deep, but Kafkaesque has now been added to my vocabulary. What I think is simply the treatment of family members towards another member who isn't ""normal"", who deviates from social norms."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 10, 2020","I think most people find Kafka either amazing or bizarre (both is true), and that is solely because of two reasons. the first one being, some are incapable of peeling the layers in a book and uncovering the deep and hidden meaning behind the words. the other thing being, some themes don't sit well, because certain emotions are foreign. but all I have to say is that this is a complete enigma and something so unique and in every sense of the word-- purely Kafkaesque and all genius."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 18, 2020","Very captivating tale, Kafka's style felt really unique and, of course, the extend of the word Kafkaesque can only be grasped by reading such a plot. The disorienting and absurd set the main character is facing, the description of how Gregor and his family are reacting to that, the bureacratic nature of a capitalistic system through the reaction of his manager... All is there to leave in suspense for the next complication."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 1, 2020","I've heard references to The Metamorphosis and I've seen ""Kafkaesque"" used as an adjective, but I've never read anything by Kafka before. (I know, it's shocking that we didn't cover... modernism? absurdism? in my Baptist high school. I know a lot about The Pilgrim's Progress, though!)"
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 23, 2021","And so begins my journey to learn how to properly use the term ""Kafkaesque"". In all seriousness though, I think this was an interesting allegorical/metaphorical tale that any number of readers could read any number of things into it. For its day too, it was probably a fairly profound and different read, though I don't think its aged very well in terms of reader enjoyability even if the concept is still interesting."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"May 7, 2022","This was my first story of Franz Kafka and it was just... bizarre. I finally get why people have coined the term 'Kafkaesque' after reading one of his stories and reading any further more stories will have me keep my guard up. But one thing is certain, the story did full justice to the title. Won't reveal anything here but if you can persevere through the pain of the characters' ordeal, you would appreciate it."
The Metamorphosis,3,"May 25, 2022",i think i will have to re-read this to really get it. but reading this made me realize how some books i have read before makes sense. i have read books that are kafkaesque so i've really been meaning to read one of kafka's popular works.
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 15, 2023",Gregor Samsa is such a weird little guy and I love him for that. He gets transformed into a horrifying bug creature and his first thought is “Awh maaan how am I gonna get to work?? :(“. His sister pours him a bowl of milk and bread crumbs and he’s like “oooo milk!” and proceeds to dunk his entire head into the bowl. Absolute creature. I love him with all of my heart and he contributed so much to the kafkaesque mood of the book by being absolutely unfazed by everything that happened to him
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 22, 2023",Pretty easy (but sad) read and i loved every bit especially “I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.” Kafka is truly amazing. And i was a fool to have expected a happy ending..not every kafkaesque of me
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 3, 2023",This third entry in my existentialist book-marathon was pretty good. Now I know exactly what Kafkaesque means. It basically the equivalent of Lynchian for literature.
The Metamorphosis,2,"January 11, 2024","For some reason lately, I've had Kafkaesque movies on my mind, from Joseph Losey's Mr. Klein (starring one of my favorite actors, Alain Delon) to Martin Scorsese's After Hours. So I decided I should finally read a Kafka story, The Metamorphosis. And it was every bit as surreal and nightmarishly oppressive as I thought it would be."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 3, 2024","pretty solid short story i liked it. as redundant as it sounds, i love kafka's kafkaesque style and this story is a great example of it. it's been a while since i've read this but like i have stated 1 million times before i love unfortunate protagonists ... gregor samsa you will always be famous . if ur family didn't appreciate u for your efforts when you were a human then i will take one for the team . made me sad . I LOVE THEMES OF ALIENATION"
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 10, 2024","Man turns into bug. Kafkaesque of course, but also surprisingly funny (to me, at least). Mixed in with the general malaise of it all is real wit and satire. Although I found nothing particularly extraordinary about the writing, this is certainly a strikingly memorable little book. The image of Gregor taking hours and hours to execute a thousand-point turn around his own bedroom is brilliant, and more relatable than one might assume."
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 27, 2024","""Confused"" sums it up perfectly. This book had me tangled in Kafkaesque knots from start to finish. I was super eager to get into Kafka’s world, I thought this slim volume would be an easy read—oh, how wrong I was! The ending left me reeling, far from what I expected. I read it twice, the second time I had gotten a gist of his style and I found myself strangely relating to the absurdity. Now, I'm keen to explore more of his works, especially his letters. Super excited!"
The Metamorphosis,2,"March 17, 2025","I can now credibly use the term “Kafkaesque”. This was bizarre, surreal and surprisingly sad. I wasn’t expecting Gregor’s family to so quickly reject him. The difference between how Gregor and his family perceived events heightened the sense of isolation and loneliness Gregor felt. They made no effort to understand him."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 18, 2025",Now I understand kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 20, 2017","Reread this with my class and I'm still not a massive fan of the piece. It is good for teaching certain skills, and the kids learned well by it, but I think I am still quite indisposed to the ""bug-ness"" and the ending choices (even if they are completely in keeping with the Existentialist philosphy, and absolutely a reflection of Kafkaesque literature)."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2019","Something so phenomenal needs to be preserved. I feel so honored to read this masterpiece of a work. The state of alienation, the conflict of morality and desire, everything fused in between two covers. It is so dark, delicate, and spontaneous that only one word can rightly describe it, Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 4, 2020","Ever heard someone say something is Kafkaesque? Read this and find out why. A thoroughly thrilling read, every page was necessary and the story was simple. Poor Gregor is changing and you will watch from his perspective as he does. My favorite part of this book is it wasn't overwrought with terrible tropes of self loathing or even a real awareness of the situation. In my opinion that is reality!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 23, 2020","Là câu hỏi mà tôi đặt ra lần đầu đọc Hóa Thân 2 năm trước, đây cũng là tác phẩm đầu tiên của Kafka mà tôi được tiếp cận. Trong một tiểu thuyết ngắn, Kafka đã đem được mọi cái tinh hoa mà danh từ ""Kafkaesque"" muốn truyền tải. Khi câu chuyện khép lại, cũng là lúc chúng ta được chứng kiến và hoàn thành 5 màn hóa thân khác nhau. Màn hóa thân của Samsa, của gia đình anh và người đọc. Bởi khi bạn gập cuốn sách này lại, bạn sẽ không còn là con người của lúc mới bắt đầu nữa."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 13, 2020",I heard the correct term is Kafkaesque but I’ve never read anything else by him. I’m not sure what to make of it. The story is well written and contains fantastical elements while “playing it straight.” It made me wonder what was the point and purpose. Was it an allegory? Either way of left me thinking about it.
The Metamorphosis,3,"February 9, 2021","I finally entered the bizarre world of Franz Kafka. Though I did not enjoy the story so much initially, it suddenly got more interesting at the end. I want to read about different interpretations of the story and discuss it. I definitely plan to read more of Kafkaesque works, so happy to hear suggestions."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 15, 2021","this was an unusually sad story that i enjoyed immensely. Metamorphosis is open for diverse interpretations that revolve around some common themes: the absurdity of life, identity, human nature, relationships ... . Also, i’ve read quite enough about Kafka to catch glimpses of his life in this book. This was my first ‘Kafkaesque’ experience and definitely not the last."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 15, 2021","I usually start the UCONN ECE class with this novella because it's short, symbolic, and the existential philosophy mirrors the concerns of a lot of my seniors, who are feeling pressured to make major decisions about colleges and careers. I also like to think that when they're in college or sitting around with a bunch of other smart people and someone describes a situation as ""Kafkaesque,"" they'll know exactly what that means. Fingers crossed that their lives all turn out happier than Gregor's, or Kafka's, for that matter."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 24, 2022",Playing the grotesque with everyday life in the same line is typical Kafka or Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 28, 2022",Very Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 14, 2023","This book can singlehandedly show you how quickly family's can turn on you, despite how close you may all seem. The situation turns from strange to bizarre to dire. Using the term kafkaesque, it's a eccentric feeling or situation that causes immense confusion, and often results in a stress to the situation the person is placed in."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 20, 2023","Metamorphosis is the primary reason the delightful adjective “kafkaesque” exists, which gives it an automatic 5/5 in my books."
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 15, 2023","i begrudgingly read this just because it was short and also to be able to knowingly use the word “kafkaesque.” in hindsight i probably read it very literally, which made for a morbid, nonsensical read. will revisit…uh, one of these days."
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 13, 2023","Now I know what I'm saying as I describe something as ""kafkaesque."" Having turned into a bug, Gregor still worries about getting to work on time. All anyone seems worried about is making ends meet even in the face of a bizarre transformation. It is a sad tale of work and family beyond that of ridiculousness. Kafka uses an absurd fantasy is used to highlight the absurdity of real, every day life."
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 22, 2023","Anyone who likes to read classics and wants to know what ""kafkaesque"" is about"
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 2, 2024",Very Kafkaesque 😏
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 3, 2024","The Metamorphosis was my introduction to Kafka. I find the “Kafkaesque” style of writing very interesting. He finds a captivating way to put the absurd into a normal slice of life, and I found more and more things about the book after discussing it with friends that read. Great intro to a great author."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 20, 2024","The bugs, the dirt, the neglect, his father's poor treatment, most of the things he hated and feared the most were all there. Then comes his embodiment of death which he apparently longed for, the last few pages were wrecking. I really cried for a long while, plus, I hate apples now. Again, Kafkaesque at its finest."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 31, 2024","What a stunning collection of short stories! Every one of them has something to love: from “The Metamorphosis”’ classic surreal Kafkaesque style, to “In the Penal Colony”’s social commentary, to “A Country Doctor”’s simply nightmarish prose. Kafka has solidified himself as one of my favorite writers with these stories, and I can’t wait to seek out and appreciate the rest of his body of work."
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 11, 2024",kafkaesque....
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2019","A strangely disturbing, yet enthralling, novella. My first introduction to Kafka's works. There's a surreal distortion to his prose, with his clear writing underscoring a rich narrative. The word 'Kafkaesque' makes a lot more sense now."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 29, 2019","I somehow went my entire life without reading Kafka, although I love the ultra-weird genre! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the whole kafkaesque ideas. I read The Trial and other short stories after. I can’t get enough."
The Metamorphosis,2,"July 13, 2020","Too many underlying plot points. Every sentence has a second meaning which is a depressing view of the life being lived by millions of modern men and women. The book is truly kafkaesque. There are no positives to take away from this book, definitely not a cozy rainy day read."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 30, 2020","And about Franz Kafka, what can we talk about him, just a word which is born out of him - ""kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 25, 2020","the book is a short story about Gregor. No explanations provided, just his thinking and others' behaviors towards the event happened to him. And by that, we understand more about the characters, more about people than the events. Very Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,2,"December 29, 2021",My only delight in having finished this thorn is that I now understand colloquial references to it and am now qualified to use Kafkaesque as a descriptor. Yay.
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 24, 2022","I do enjoy Kafka's works, but this one was hella sad. It got me thinking about the whole Kafkaesque concept, and about the mentally space occupied by one's duty and economy. Cool concept, and I get why he is well known, but this is not the shit I should be reading rn..."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 31, 2022","Twas a good book for my short train ride, I dig the kafkaesque work thoroughly somehow a nice Halloween read aswell, the end was bittersweet although I would've loved if Kafka went deeper into the thoughts of Gregor as he breathed the last few breaths of his life"
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 9, 2022","Good read, finally I've been able to grasp what is meant by 'Kafkaesque'. I do have to admit that I think that reading the English translation probably is the reason that the book didn't meet my expectations (after looking up the original German version). Still recommend though."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 20, 2023",A bugging commentary on family and work in a capitalist society. Makes you wonder who really is the pest in a Kafkaesque world. It certainly is a story that could make you tick in many ways. I'm just writing this to make puns.
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 10, 2023","fun fact: el nombre original se traduce más a “transformación”, sin embargo, siento que es adecuado el título por el cambio que ocurre desde el principio del libro :).. leánlo, es un staple en la lectura, kafkaesque~"
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 15, 2023","I read this with my seniors in high school for the first time. We're discussing this novella being a metaphor for mental health.

The Metamorphosis,4,"December 30, 2023","really enjoyed reading this one. not much to say on it right now, i need to let it slow cook in my brain before i can be insufferable and use 'kafkaesque' à tort et à travers"

The Metamorphosis,5,"February 17, 2024","Listened to this as an audiobook because I wanted to understand the metamorphosis memes and what it means when something is ""Kafkaesque."" I'm not sure it helped but I think that's part of the charm :)"
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 4, 2024","Audiobooked. I plan to read Murakami's ""Kafka on the Shore"" soon and wanted some context. I also want to be qualified to use the work ""Kafkaesque"" correctly, while drinking a martini with well educated acquaintances in a bar filled with lots of polished mahogany and tartan carpeting."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 8, 2024","i think it was quite funny in a strange way but i felt really bad for gregor. four stars because the ending was kind of weird, but overall i liked it. if you like absurdist humor/tragedy then metamorphosis is great for you. i now have a better grasp of what kafkaesque means lol"
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 12, 2025","This is really kafkaesque!! I really feel bad for Gregor, he dont deserved to be treated like that 🥲"
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 27, 2025","I can't believe I waited so damn long to read this book. I actually read it just a few years ago, but it's definitely something I should have read in high school. This book is so similar to something I would write. Read it so you can stop pretending to understand when someone says, ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 19, 2025","Reader, although this was of course very well-written, I did not like this book at all. Poor, poor Gregor. It is so sad. I could not claim open-heartedly that I understand what it means for something to be ‘Kafkaesque’ after reading this. I just know that it was a sad story."
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 16, 2025","The Metamorphosis aids in defining kafkaesque, illustrating nightmarishly bizarre situations to reflect the truth of our society. In this case Kafka targets capitalism and work being one's raison d'être and what should happen if we loose ourselves to these ideals through magical realism."

The Metamorphosis,3,"February 25, 2019","My first book by the legendary German writer Franz Kafka, who gave us the adjective Kafkaesque. Gregor Samsa woke up one morning to find that he had become a beetle-like bug and a disgrace to his family. He could not longer go to his clerical job, and languished in his room. His parents felt lost and frustrated and his sister eventually felt he should be gotten rid of. Alas he died on his own accord eventually. This novella is a metaphor for the alienation and helplessness of modern man in the face of changes over which he has no control. I was not exactly absorbed by the narrative, so it’s only a 3 star book for me. Sorry Kafka."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 29, 2020",I hope to read The Trial later this year. Just to understand the pattern that has lead to the famous(/infamous) word - Kafkaesque. Wish me luck!

The Metamorphosis,3,"August 19, 2015","It is difficult to review this collection as a whole, because it includes stories spanning Kafka's literary career which are widely different both stylistically and in terms of content. At the same time, I don't want to review each story separately, particularly since there really isn't that much to say about quite a few of them. So I will try to strike a middle ground and just say a few words about each of the most significant stories.[return][return]My favorite is probably ""The Stoker"". It is, perhaps not coincidentally, the most realistic, least ""Kafkaesque"" of them, almost like something Joseph Conrad might have written. It tells of a young man traveling to America who tries to help a stoker on the ship seek justice from the captain against his boss, who he claims gives preferential treatment to his own countrymen. During the interview with the captain, however, the young man is recognized and carted off by his uncle, an American senator. The story is described as ""a fragment"", though it is fairly complete in itself (indeed frankly one of the least fragmentary stories here). But though published separately, it was actually the first chapter of Kafka's unfinished novel, Amerika.[return][return]Then there is ""In the Penal Colony"". It is also quite realistic for Kafka, perhaps excessively so, as it becomes almost surreal in its sheer gruesome brutality. It is about a visitor from a civilized nation to a small backward one ruled by a military dictatorship being shown the workings of their execution device, a torture machine which tattoos the offense of the criminal (who is given no opportunity to mount a defense before he is sentenced and executed) on his body repeatedly, more and more deeply into the skin and underlying tissues until the prisoner bleeds to death in agonizing slowness, after which his body is unceremoniously dumped into a pit. I can't say much more without spoiling the ending, but let's just say the conclusion, while shocking, is also somewhat satisfying.[return][return]The story at the heart of the collection is, of course, ""The Metamorphosis"", a strange but interesting tale about a man who awakens one morning from troubled dreams to find himself transformed into a giant vermin (as the opening sentence famously informs us). The story follows his initial efforts to carry on living normally, the reactions of his family, and his decreasing humanity over time until his ultimate death, much to his family's relief. Bizarre, but nevertheless somewhat fascinating in a ""WTF?"" sort of way. Read it as a sort of existential thought-experiment, I guess.[return][return]""A Report to an Academy"", probably my next favorite after ""The Stoker"", is a sort of reverse-""Metamorphosis""---it is narrated by an ape who describes how he came to behave like a human being, to the extent that he says he can no longer adequately describe his previous experience as an ape. While perhaps not exactly light-hearted, it is at least somewhat less dark and more humorous than most of the other stories.[return][return]The rest of the stories, such ..."

The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"April 16, 2018",Me: Franz Kafka? Kafka? Progenitor of the word Kafkaesque?
The Metamorphosis,3,"June 17, 2020",I don't really know what to say about this classic but that it was truly bizarre and sad. I knew going into this famous book that it was about a man turning into a bug but I had no idea it was so abrupt. How did this happen? Why did this happen? I thought he must be a scientist akin to Jeff Goldblum in The Fly but no. The family treats him as if he has somehow brought this on himself. I can imagine if I had some sort of debilitating accident and relied on my family to care for me but instead they locked me away and fed me with scraps. It's not a spoiler to say that Gregor dies in the end but the worst part is that his family goes on as if he never existed. A good introduction to what Kafkaesque really means. It's also very short so ideal for anyone who can't read longer books.
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 19, 2021","Let's start off by saying, I am so upset with Gregor's family and his fate. This book made me so sad, it's beautiful, relatable, simple, devastating, to the point where I'm not even sure I fully understood it to its full potential, but I felt it. This is the first book I've read of Kafka, I've had high expectations and they were definitely met. I loved how abandonment and loneliness were portrayed by this short story, it was heartbreaking. The ending was unexpected and devastating how his family was very optimistic after his death. This book reflects hella daddy issues, and I get the term 'Kafkaesque', anyways this book was one crazy and eye-opening fever dream. The ending was his sister stretching her body in a ""vivacious"" and ""beautiful"" way, similar to how Gregor stretched his insect legs at the start, indicating that Greta his sister finalized the metamorphosis, his family take a day off in the country and seem satisfied with their life without Gregor. Sad, loved it, ughhhh. This reflects so sadly on how his family treated him. This book was very symbolic, I interpreted this as generally what the term 'Kafkaesque' means, in this context the character (Gregor) find himself in an illogical and weird situation that he can't make sense of yet has hope to get himself out of it, this hope leads him to death. Then, there's the idea that by Gregor working to fill the obligation of his family's financial state he has literally dehumanized himself."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 27, 2016","This was my first time reading Kafka, and I really didn't know what to expect. I was mainly excited about now being able to use the term 'Kafkaesque' with some legitimacy, but I was happy to find I enjoyed his writing as well. As with any translation, it's hard to know how much of that is Kafka and how much is due to the translation, in this case by Susan Bernofsky, but whatever the formula, the final product was a pleasure to read."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 5, 2013",The metamorphosis was the first book from Kafka which I read and the moment I finished reading it I understood why the word Kafkaesque was coined and why it means what it means.
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 9, 2020","This is a typical Kafka story, similar to his unfinished novels. Most of the text is the narrator's obsessive introspection, carried out to humorous excess. Not much happens, and what does happen is mostly surreal and absurd, extremely absurd but still logical. The Metamorphosis is Kafkaesque. There is no ending; the story just falls apart."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 10, 2020","Peculiar COVID read when life feels rather kafkaesque .. about a man with a “complicated” relationship to work, who goes through a transformation and experiencing intense alienation and isolation 😬"
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 21, 2024","call me crazy, but i find this rather kafkaesque"
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 4, 2022","I don't know why people think this book is so fun; I was upset the whole way through. Any Kafkaesque metaphor has my sympathy and moral companionship. That said, I felt the characters were dull and stagnant. I suppose that is the point, but it also felt a bit repetitive. 3/5 for the creativity, thoughtfulness, and valid social commentary."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 10, 2023",Blij dat ik nu eindelijk begrijp wat kafkaësk/kafkaesque betekent
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 21, 2024",After reading the book over 11 times and doing a going through a lots of philosophies I have finally decided time write a review for the most famous Kafkaesque..
The Metamorphosis,3,"October 30, 2024",Väldigt kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 8, 2016","I've always been intimidated by Kafka, and thus have always avoided his work. I thought Kafka was for ""literary types"" who swoon over Romantic-era poetry. I thought Kafka fans were people who become giddy over obscure phrasings like, ""her lonely middle toe"" or ""his socially inept bicep,"" who nod and smile in grave understanding as they sip their latté in a local, back alley café. Anyone I had ever heard utter the term ""Kafkaesque"" was usually some black beret and matching turtleneck-wearing, pipe-smoking snob who spoke with a contrived affectation and harrumphed at you in a condescendingly detached manner."
The Metamorphosis,2,"March 6, 2017","A very strange, surreal story that has helped me to understand the term 'Kafkaesque'."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 30, 2021","With this book, the term ""Kafkaesque"" is attributed to all of Kafka's literature, which understands the absurd. The metamorphosis begins with Gregorio Sansa transformed into an insect, despite this, he worries about his work and tries to get up. His family asks for him, but his voice has changed. His boss comes to the house to urge him to leave, and at so much insistence, Gregorio bites the latch on the door and leaves his room. The fright is evident. The father takes his cane and threatens Gregorio to enter his room."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 9, 2023",this is so Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 25, 2024",I learned what Kafkaesque means and it never felt so relevant. Bureaucracy and working to live mixed with suffering and surrealism? Sign me up dude. This is me 100% I already wrote about and vibed with this concept before even reading him. This was so sad and made me think.
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 17, 2020","Exceptional , I am in love kafkaesque . The way he presents reaction to situation, normal &amp; extraordinary , is a clear walkthrough into kafka's life and simultaneously correlates to everyone of us ."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 22, 2018","The Metamorphosis is probably the book that has been used the most in discussions with the sole purpose of sounding intelligent. If you're philosophically inclined, you can interpret the story in multiple ways. Add to that some background knowledge of existentialism and nihilistic literature along with a working definition of ""kafkaesque"", you can easily make your mark in any party - provided that you're in the right circles."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"July 18, 2024",kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 8, 2025","Kafkaesque hay Kiểu Kafka - thường dùng để nói tới những trải nghiệm cực kì khó chịu, đáng sợ và khó hiểu. Frederick R. Karl - người nghiên cứu tiểu sử của Kafka nói về thuật ngữ này: “Một thế giới siêu thực mà trong đó tất cả các kế hoạch của bạn, toàn bộ cách bạn điều khiển hành vi của mình, bắt đầu tan vỡ ra thành từng mảnh khi bạn thấy mình chống lại một thế lực không hề hoạt động theo cách bạn nghĩ. Bạn không từ bỏ, bạn không nằm xuống chờ chết. Bạn đã đấu tranh bằng mọi thứ mình có. Nhưng tất nhiên, bạn không có lấy một cơ hội nào. Đó là Kafkaesque."""
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 15, 2020","A strange but very interesting tale. I couldn't help but feel bad for the poor man who people wanted to forget about once he'd transformed into an insect. It's quite interesting to get into the mind of a creature. I've had that experience with a few other novels, including ones about a rat, elephants and dogs. Shortly after reading this short book, I saw the term Kafkaesque (def. used to describe a confusing, illogical or frightening situation that involves a lot of complicated rules that do not make sense) used in another book. You know you've had an impact with your work when a new word is created from your name!"
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 8, 2021","The past few months analyzing Kafka’s writing through in-class discussions, other works, and his personal life have illuminateed a new lens in which to read the Metamorphosis. His other works (A Hunger Artist and Before the Law) have allowed me to cherish the monstrous, ironic Kafkaesque brand, transforming my approach to his craft from burdensome to explorative. Peer discussion focused on applying a Marxist approach to the text illuminated Gregor’s family’s actions as a commodification of Gregor, caring for him only as long as he brings money to the family. The book becomes even more profound in light of Kafka’s personal life, his opinion on human relationships (shaped by his failed experiences) is confessed through his construction of Gregor’s broken family."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 20, 2025",Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 4, 2021",Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"February 19, 2015","After my blow to the head, I could I could identify with everybody in the book. I got into it. My family is quite Kafkaesque. Indeed, I think the majority of families (90%) is Kafkaesque: thoroughly fucked up!  I would be a mix of Grete and the pre-metamorphosis papa Samsa. POOR GREGOR! T____T Are classics ever happy?  The last classic I’ve read is Things fell apart, in which my heart went out to poor little Okonkwo… He’s not a straightforward protagonist whose thoughts are made accessible to the reader and I still felt his pain. That’s wonderful, isn’t it? Perhaps it’s easier to identify with protagonists who are going through a lot of misfortune. Wait, I don’t agree with myself there. Happy books are also great! In general, I think that we humans focus too much on the negative side of things. We might be evolutionally programmed like that, but it’s 2015. We have a chance to find a balance between being the evolution and transcending it. FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE, PEOPLE! That’s why I hate the news(papers) so much. Books are a little different. They can give off plain negative energy (DUTCH LITERATURE, Ulysses) and fuzzy negative energy (No longer human, Things fall apart, The metamorphosis, Oyasumi Punpun, which is a manga). I’m trying to say that books can be positively depressing, while the news and such are negatively depressing."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 14, 2022","The vacant occupancy of the human experience is appropriately the lifeblood of existentialist theory - fiction, non-fiction, academic, millennial. There is a powerful pull in the absurd, that promises respite from the circumstantial ideas of hope and resilience. Probably this explains the overuse of the term Kafkaesque in modern times, which, pointedly, despite being overused, is not essentially an overkill."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 8, 2024","Reading this collection naturally led me to compare the stories to each other. Beyond the well-known nightmarishly ""kafkaesque"" quality, these stories share many motifs. I collected some of these similarities I found and summarized them in these guiding questions for Kafka's stories:"
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 19, 2024","Many of these stories are, of course, Kafkaesque with a lot of negativity. A man turns into a bug and slowly is pushed from his family and left to die. A monkey turns into a man out of his need to survive. A woman’s face deteriorates just like her dresses. No happy endings occur. Kafka quotes “there is infinite hope, but not for us”. To me, there is a satisfying aspect of the stories ending as they do. Gregor dies at peace, the officer dies at the hands of the machine he admired and tortured others with."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 2, 2021","I can see the appeal of Kafta from these short stories but overall I did not find it a pleasant or enlightening read. Instead the stories left more a sensation of unease and a sense of the surreal, which I suppose is what is meant by Kafkaesque. Is the intended takeaway that the world (not necessarily god or fate, which seem absent) is arbitrary, nonsensical, and cruel? Perhaps it was more unusual at the time to encounter such a despairing message."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 22, 2017","In short, I could technically see why Franz's works was hallmarked as the foundations for his own genre (or, Kafkaesque). The flow in here was all sewn together here as a perfectly balanced story set in a backdrop that is slooooooowly getting even more darker, but shines with a little bit, for me, too much gleaming light that is unnecessary for the story as the ending."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 10, 2018","Franz Kafka, a German/Bohemian Jewish Novelist is known for many of such stories like 'The Trial', 'The Judgement' , 'The Castle' etc which explore many surrealistic predicaments people find themselves in. His writing eventually gave rise to the term 'kafkaesque', an adjective intending to represent bizzare and nightmarish qualities depicted in his works."
The Metamorphosis,5,"June 13, 2020","Kafka’s work often considered as stunningly nervous confusion style, his works were published over and over, translated into many languages becoming the landmarks of 20th century. Today, people use the word Kafkaesque to signify the senseless and sinister complexity."
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 22, 2023","there are a million words i could say to describe the profound symbolism that is displayed countless times throughout the story, and none would truly piece together enough to match how artistic and well thought out the metaphors and symbols kafka used were. existentialism itself is already a hard concept to fathom, but a unique one nonetheless, and kafka depicted it in an absolutely amazing way throughout the life of gregor samsa and his absurd circumstance. kafkaesque is truly a neat concept that is impossible to replicate! franz kafka definitely had a unique mind and talent for literature to be able to create this concept, and it specifically shows throughout this novella."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 11, 2014","That ""spring"" when the family's direction took a new hopeful turn was a little too eclectic although probably that's what characterizes Kafkaesque. There was no sense of justice, or at least on the basis of how I perceive justice."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"April 2, 2020","This sorrowful disposition is quite evident in his writing, both in content and style. Perhaps no line of his is more telling of this fact than the opening sentence of The Metamorphosis: “As Gregor Samsa awoke from unsettling dreams one morning, he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.” Nightmare and reality are reversed, or rather, nightmare has become reality. From his harrowing tale The Metamorphosis to the tragic father-son relationship in The Judgement, Kafka’s unique style and perspective are deserving of their own adjective: Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"January 19, 2025","The Metamorphosis is heartbreaking in the simplest, most Kafkaesque way possible. Imagine waking up one morning to find out you’ve transformed into a giant bug. What’s the first thing that crosses your mind? Not, ""How do I get back to being human?"" Not, ""What the heck is going on?"" No, it’s: ""Oh no, I’m late for work!"" Gregor Samsa, in his bug-like state, doesn’t miss a beat in caring only about providing for his family, even as his body has literally turned into an insect. If that’s not dedication, I don’t know what is."
The Metamorphosis,5,"July 7, 2013","Most people are probably somewhat familiar with Franz Kafka. When we hear that something is Kafkaesque we think of the surreal and the absurd, but with a darkness. The Metamorphosis is possibly his most well known story. The tale of a travelling salesman who wakes one morning and finds that he is a giant beetle or cockroach. How many of us know the rough outline without ever having read the actual work?"
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 7, 2022","A Country Doctor perfectly captures the abstract, confusing feeling of a terrifying nightmare. The doctor seems to move through time and space at unreasonable speeds, and every action of the characters around him is unpredictable. Doors are as easy to break through as butter, worms wiggle out of angry red wounds, and naked men crawl through snow with choruses surrounding them. The Country Doctor is terrifying, revolting, and perfectly Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 7, 2022","the penguin edition is a great, compact selection of kafka's short stories. minor highlights include the terse prose poems of ""contemplation"" and ""a country doctor"" (""before the law"" is a huge standout among these very short works for its satirical presentation of bureaucratic labyrinths and the complacence of the human psyche all in the span of just 2 pages). the torturous fates of artists in relation to the unbiased, uncaring ignorance that pervades their world as depicted in ""a hunger-artist"" and ""josefine the singer"" are also presented in typical kafkaesque (finally i get to use that word as it was intended!) fashion of ironic detachment with flashes of surreal humour and absurdity."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 10, 2013","Brilliant. But The Penal Colony is the only reason I can't finish the entire book of short stories. If you've started it, you know why I can't seem to finish it. Saying I really liked the Kafkaesque stories is not really possible. That they are brilliant, unique and utterly fascinating however is true."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 27, 2013","It's Kafkaesque yo! (Sorry, Breaking Bad has now moved back into top of mind status.)"
The Metamorphosis,2,"May 9, 2016","I found this book to be really abnormal. Gregor Samsa, the main character, who is a traveling salesman wakes up to find himself to be a large insect. He stays in this state until his family can't take care of him and decides to kill him. It was honestly really hard to follow the story because I couldn't really catch the details that quickly. This book was really dreary and dark from start to finish which I found was a strength. I figured that the writing style was known as Kafkaesque which is a surreal writing style symbolizing the absurdity of life which I found was very unique to that period. The significant part of this book was that it was written in the early 1900's and back then Jews and disliked races were treated harshly and put into death camps. The author himself was a Jew so this book was a way to probably convey his feelings and how the bug represented him of being shut out of the real world and no one accepting him for who he is. He also conveys a theme that life is illogical and absurd because although the man turns into a monstrous vermin, they don't act too shocked along with the fact that there is no explanation for his transformation and how he doesn't change back to a human and instead he dies making his family happy and relieved. Overall, this book didn't have the best story line yet it was kind of interesting to read."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 12, 2020","Tidak akan berpura-pura bahwa setelah membaca ini mendapatkan sebuah ilham atau terpesona dengan niat penulis. Tapi satu hal yang pasti setiap cerpen akan memberikan sebuah maksud dari penulis baik perenungan si tokoh atau bentuk simbolis yang diselipkan. Entah itu yang disebut Kafkaesque, bisa jadi. Ada ciri khas dari sudut pandang dan pengambilan cerita, tentunya suatu yang tak biasa."
The Metamorphosis,3,"February 22, 2022","After hearing about Metamorphosis off and on for years I finally picked up the book and gave it a read. I do not consider myself overly cultured, and have considered Kafka to be such for the entirety of my life thus far. It wasn't nearly as difficult to handle as I thought it would be. I was able to read through the book fairly quickly, understood a fair amount of the themes(with some help from the foreword, which I saved to read AFTER reading the actual stories), and understood a bit what it means to be Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"May 15, 2015","This novella is intriguing from the beginning. Who would think to write a story about a human transforming into a bug? Gregor, the main character, is a young man providing for his family. This story explains his stress and feelings of being trapped. For example, at the beginning, he cannot get out of bed. The reader can feel his stress and feel almost trapped themselves. There is a lot to read into when reading this story. One may think the bug was not supposed to represent a bug at all, but maybe a mental state for being trapped. For example, when Gregor talks about nobody understanding him, you can replace his bug-like state to be a mental state in which nobody can understand how he really feels or what he is really thinking. There is also a huge transformation in which each character goes through. His sister, Grete, is probably one of the most transformed characters throughout the novella. She goes from feeling pity for Gregor to almost despising him. This story is captivating and compels the reader to read more. This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys kafkaesque types of literature."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 24, 2016","Although not really ""my kind"" of book, it was moderately enjoyable. It is said to be representative of Kafka's work and the commonly-used term ""Kafkaesque."" While some think both the protagonist's and his family's response to his horrific metamorphosis is way out of line with the situation presented in the story, one who reads other East European authors in particular see a similar emphasis on shame, so Kafka was really only exaggerating an apparently very real part of daily life. The story is short and generally well done, though the ending is somewhat abrupt and fuzzy. Perhaps like a Monty Python movie, once the story passes a certain point of absurd, it is hard to find a way to tie it all up and wind it all down coherently. Apparently Gregor's support of his family was really holding them all back from what they could be, and his gradual demise releases them to pursue their real potentials. One can also draw a number of other lessons from the story, but despite the surface surrealism, there are no doubt kernels of very real truth to be found in it as well. Worth the time to read."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 15, 2017",Very Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 21, 2019",The word 'kafkaesque' brought expectations that were simply not what Kafka is about. I feel that this word has been thrown around haphazardly by people who haven't read Kafka's works.
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 27, 2016","'The Metamorphosis' is a novella by Franz Kafka, one of the most influential names in German literature. Most of the works of Franz Kafka were published posthumously. Since then the works of Franz Kafka have become very popular and his style of writing is now known as 'Kafkaesque', which is defined in dictionaries as something 'marked by surreal distortion and often a sense of impending danger.' The depiction of human feelings in 'The Metamorphosis' and his other works and the level of emotional details is a literary achievement in itself."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 30, 2017","Franz Kafka's utterly bizarre short story almost single-handedly gave rise to the creation a new word in literary criticism – Kafkaesque. Without so much as a paragraph of preamble, it starts with its protagonist, travelling salesman Gregor Samsa, awakening to find he has been transformed into a “monstrous vermin”, resembling a dung beetle. No explanation is offered as to how or why this has occurred – we must accept the surreality of this premise, and how it affects the otherwise mundane events around the tale. Far more words have been written on the meaning of The Metamorphosis than Kafka used in creating it. One interpretation could be that Gregor's plight is analogous with that of a disabled person, and how his parents and sister are to accommodate his new-found helplessness. Though there is a tragic air to the story, it is also a pitch black comedy, as seen when the insect-like Gregor tries to assure his colleague that he is fit to continue working, much to the colleague's terror."
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 12, 2018","Kafka is all of us, even when we don't want to admit it. We are him in our darkest side, we are him when we are alone, terrified, and being tired of all mundance, obscure, and repetitif habit that called life in society. In his nightmarish world that filled with all of the despair and loneliness, his world as an irony become poetics, and become our saviour as he experience the despair itself, and it's become so powerfull that his part of himself in all of his writing including this, influences many people and writer and the term ""kafkaesque"" become famous. From his vivid in dark-nighmaris world we found him in all of us."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 12, 2025",y gracias a esta novela porque ahora me siento capaz de decir #kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,2,"December 17, 2011","I'm not sure why I found it so boring. Maybe it's too ""Literary"" with a capital L. Maybe because I find people who use the word ""Kafkaesque"" to be inherently pretentious. Maybe because I can't read the book in the original German. Maybe, but probably not."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 15, 2014","I've had a lifetime of throwing ""Kafkaesque"" around without ever actually reading any, and The Metamorphosis surprised me in a lot of ways. It was much funnier than I was led to believe, much sharper and strikingly less contemplative than I'd thought. It also just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I wanted to squash Gregor Samsa sniveling under that couch long before his family did. He didn't seem all that likable as a person and maybe that's the point."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 18, 2024","/ˌkæf.kəˈesk/ extremely unpleasant, frightening, and confusing, and similar to situations described in the novels of Franz Kafka: He is caught up in a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare. The urban landscape is invested with a nightmarish, Kafkaesque bleakness."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 1, 2025","Ce texte parvient encore à hanter mes pensées plus de 5 ans après ma première lecture. L’image du cancrelat est si puissante dans la culture populaire. Suivant ma relecture, j’affirme que La Métamorphose demeure, sans doute, une de mes œuvres littéraires préférées. La forme littérature chez Kafka ne me paraît pas exceptionnelle, mais l’histoire qu’elle raconte évoque de tels sentiments chez le lecteur. Mes éléments préférés du texte : l’absurdité de l’environnement familial, la prose pathétique de Kafka, la tragédie de l’amour et du rejet. Des éléments d’autofiction, d’absurdité et de tragédie forme ce récit qui ne cesse de réclamer mon attention. Parfois je questionne si j’accorderai une si haute opinion à cette nouvelle si je l’avais lu plus tard dans ma vie. Mais, trop tard, le style kafkaesque est gravée dans ma mémoire comme la pomme dans le dos de Gregor, et je ne peux que en raffoler."
The Metamorphosis,2,"July 27, 2014","I read this book for approximately two reasons. First, because I had it in my head or from some list that it is a classic. I try to read things that are classics from time to time. Second, I wanted to be able to use the term Kafkaesque with a greater degree of credibility, and reading this short book seemed a good way to achieve that level of literary cred. Also, I wanted a short library audiobook to put on my iPod while I mowed the lawn, and this one turned up quickly."
The Metamorphosis,3,"January 29, 2025","Pretty short and bizarre. I finally understand what the word Kafkaesque means lol. Def gives off some Covid era vibes. Greg staying in his room hiding while his sister quickly brings in food and closes the door felt almost identical to when I was locked away when I had Covid. The absurdity of his situation is quite funny, I like how his first thought when he turned into a bug was that his boss wouldn’t let him take a sick day. And I didn’t like how ungrateful his family was at all. Once he loses his ability to provide for his family he literally loses all worth to his family and is isolated and dehumanized. I don’t like how only his transformation brought the family closer together but against him, I feel like by supporting his family they were each just mooching off him without growing. Major grandpa Joe Willy Wonka vibes. Overall p good but I prefer Camus’s depiction of absurdity."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 4, 2025","Something about this book bugs me. It might be the repetition of threes. Three parts to the story, three doors to Gregor’s room, three lodgers, three stages of Gregor’s metamorphosis. There are probably at least three more threes, maybe more. At one point I could count them easily, but the memory of this novella, short story, fades. Interesting to wonder what is lost in translation. Words carry weight. When Gregor is transformed into the German word that is used in the book to name what he becomes, what English word was chosen? What nuance is lost? What shading is added? Which word is used in which translation? That selection introduces a kind of wobble, these word choices, and over the course of several thousand words it is a testament to the power of these words that it survives this metamorphism at all. It’s Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 25, 2010","It was just as disgustingly hilarious and terribly sad as I remembered. Poor old Gregor Samsa. For those of you not familiar with the story, Gregor wakes up one morning worrying about having overslept and missing the training to his hated job as a traveling salesman. But he can't go to work because he has turned into a gargantuan beetle. There is really no explanation for the change... it just happens (thus the term Kafkaesque.) Though you would think that the story would just continue from the first page to be so absurd and fanstastic that you would not be able to relate, you really end up sympathetic. And the details are just so wonderfully gross... he leaves tracks on the walls as scuttles across them..."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 7, 2015","According to the urban dictionary Kafkaesque means; a nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to, although strongly surreal. Turning into a beatle (and not a singing and guitar playing one), certainly falls under the nightmare category. But what makes this book interesting is that, dispite it's bizar nature, the story is still relatable. Just like the urban dictionary said. What I like about the story is that it doesn't dwell on how or why the transformation happend, it just happend. As a reader you are allowed to form your own thoughts about the origin of the metamorphosis. If you want to experience Kafka, I would recommend Metamorphosis, it's a short but interesting read."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 13, 2014","The essence of Kafka is harder to distil than the existence of the word ""Kafkaesque"" might suggest. His world is, and is not, hopeless."
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 7, 2019",Milan Kundera on the “Kafkaesque”
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 1, 2020",This collection of short stories by Kafka contains some of the author's most known stories including Metamorphosis and A hunger artist and exhibits the very best of the writer: what makes a situation Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 21, 2020","Of course, reading Franz Kafka's book really gave me a better understanding about Kafkaesque. Before I read this book I only knew it as a mere concept. This book tells us about The Kafkaesque in many and various circumstances. And how this concept even could be applied not only in an industrial setting, but in so many more."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 16, 2022","Being Kafkaesque, reading Kafka is a pleasure always."
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 13, 2024","I read the graphic novel version of this novella a few years back, and decided to pick up the original. I've heard a bit about the existential dread surrounding Kafka's work, commonly dubbed ""Kafkaesque"". The novella is extremely short, clocking in at just 50 pgs. There's loads to interpret and analyze, with seemingly every sentence being symbolic of some great ideal. However, the loads of meaning behind the passages doesn't really change how boring they are. I hope to read more of Kafka's novels soon."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 29, 2011","despite being familiar with it, had never read the actual text of this story till now . . i did like it for the initial ""kafkaesque"" scenario and how simply and matter-of-factly everything flowed from that . . i liked the shortness of it . . how it all circled around the one conflict, the metamorphosis (metamorphoses, really) that followed, and that's it . . thematically, i like how such a simple story begs for huge and varied applications . . with something so two-dimensional, it almost demands--as fairy tales do--that the characters, events, etc. become vessels to fill with whatever three-dimensional meaning we might want . ."
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 31, 2017","Kafka has been on my to read list for probably a decade. Maybe it's a blessing that I picked up his book now, I wonder if I would have liked/ truly understood his writing style 10 years ago. a lot of his short stories in the collection are nothing less than genius. ""The Metamorphosis"" is really engrossing and the underlying theme very powerful. Some of the essence of his writing is lost in translation (he was a German writer whose works have been translated to English) but still makes for very interesting perspectives. I finally understand ""kafkaesque"" and am looking forward to reading more bizarre works from this author."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 14, 2020","On a side note, I was happy to find out that ""The Metamorphosis"" influenced David Lynch's ""Eraserhead."" Reading ""A Country Doctor"" had the same type of surreal/absurd elements I find in Lynch's work, where events take the form of dream logic. Would it be safe to say Lynch's work is Kafkaesque? Does the term Lynchian invoke Kafkaesque qualities? Or can we use these terms interchangeably? Most importantly, who cares?"
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 18, 2023","I didn't know what to expect of Kafka, I just knew he wrote literature. I was a bit skeptic as well when I found out they were short stories. Well I was quite delighted to find out that his writing is really something special. Not all his writing I liked, but in multiple ones he managed to invoke a feeling in me that I have never felt before, did not know that could be felt and am still clueless as to how he did that with just choice of words in a story of a few pages. I now understand why the word ""Kafkaesque"" exists as to at least give that feeling or ambience a name."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 8, 2024","I remember reading this story in comic strip form in my sophomore language arts class in high school. Something about the writing and story made me feel so isolated and genuinely distraught. Having read the short story in its entirety now I can fully appreciate Kafka and his unique writing style as well as storytelling skills. Metamorphosis is a genuinely disturbing story about isolation and what alienation does to a person. That same disturbing energy was present upon reading the whole story as it was when I was 16 years old. Overall a great story, I can't wait to read more Kafka and dive deeper into the true meaning of kafkaesque"
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 18, 2008","""Reading a Kafka short story is like running a race. You find yourself fighting to read, like a passerby trying not to look at a crime scene or accident victim. Because we know what “Kafkaesque” means, we know what to expect from the author. Yet, we read the tales, knowing the end might be neither just nor reasonable. This absurdity separates Kafka’s tales from those of Rod Serling’s Twilight Zone -- Serling tended to teach lessons and dispense justice while Kafka merely taunted his characters, then they suffered."""
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 15, 2012","I have to admit: there are two reasons for my reading of this novella and neither of them has much to do with my actual interest in the story. I chose to read this because: a) I am now the proud owner of a poster depicting a scene from this book wherein the words are used to make the picture [kind of like an emoticon, but less annoying ;0)] and b) I wanted to be able to add the word ‘Kafkaesque’ into my vernacular. With that in mind, the following is my review of the book."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 5, 2013","Kafka's Metamorphosis is an incredibly unsettling, anxiety-causing metaphorical insight into the psychological and social trappings of capitalism (or at least this is how I read it). The all-important and obvious theme of alienation and estrangement is poignantly pressed upon the reader through the disturbing transformation of the main character into a human-sized insect. From its engaging, obscurantist beginnings to its miserable and tragic endings, The Metamorphosis is a shocking, yet necessary introduction into the Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 6, 2015","Everyone has read ""The Matamrphosis,"" but for me, the other stories in this collection are the one's worth treasuring. ""The Country Doctor"" is one trip worth navigating, if only for the sublimative duality entangled with such a bizarre dream narrative. ""The Stoker"" is my fave even though it's probably the least Kafkaesque, accessible and linear as it is. Yeah, it's another thought-provoking examiniation of a dream, but this time it's the American Dream, and ""The Stoker"" feels just as relevant today as when Kafka wrote it."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"July 21, 2016","Unequivocally the most imaginative piece of literature I've read in years. The beauty ironically lies in the acute description of the irrational guilt, self-pity, fear, paranoia and melancholy of the leading character. I could call it a masterpiece of magical realism, or a disturbing satire on the capitalist culture of our times. Yet the most suitable word, and perhaps a combination of each aspect of the story as mentioned above, would be Kafkaesque - a senselessly surreal account on a distressingly complex situation."
The Metamorphosis,1,"June 28, 2016","I feel like that's a fitting sentiment for this book, so I'll leave my review at that. Maybe I'll come back to it one day and try to transmute the confusion and monotony of my deep dislike for this book into something intelligible. Right now, though, it seems like a lost cause. How's that for Kafkaesque?"
The Metamorphosis,4,"October 13, 2016","Franz Kafka digs in deep through your psychology and tickles it with his vague but astonishingly thought provoking storytelling. This one's about how Gregor Samsa, a rather ordinary gentleman suddenly transforms into a vicious insect. And how everyone around him is affected by this abrupt change. Powerful imagery with that added tinge of Kafkaesque narration! This is indeed a classic! The Metamorphosis is sure to amuse you and rattle that little squishy thing inside your skull, for your own good!"
The Metamorphosis,5,"February 12, 2017","There's a reason why Kafkaesque is associated means ""having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality."" This author definitely knows how to creep people out. What I loved about this book in particular is the message that it brings. It is definitely a must-read for the working class, especially those who are the bread winners of their families."
The Metamorphosis,3,"June 13, 2019","This harrowing narrative of a clerk, Gregor Samsa, who wakes from “uneasy dreams” to find himself transformed into a giant insect, is the quintessential Kafkaesque tale. Gregor is not dreaming; he really has become a bug who hides under the sofa to keep from horrifying his mother, and who is pummeled with apples and cursed by his father. The strange magic of the story is the way Kafka sustains our empathy with this creature, such that the bizarre and claustrophobic scenes intensify, and even haunt, our awareness of human vulnerability."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 2, 2018","1. this book has allowed me to now understand what ""kafkaesque"" means more vividly. i have been surrounded by the term for a while but after going shortcut with different articles and definitions found online, (the) one short story is truly the answer."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 27, 2007",I felt this was a necessity for me to read to understand why I kept hearing references to Kafkaesque. I read it straight through one Sunday morning when I was waiting for my very late ride to work. I wish I'd read it sooner. It's great. To metaphorically say that a life of spineless commonplace acceptance of being mundane will make you in to a spineless waste of existence is a provoking statement.
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 8, 2012","This is a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find he has turned into a big insect. Because of this strange event he loses his job and his family doesn't know what to do with him. I read this story in french to improve my skill in that language. So I don't know if I comprehended it completely but it was a very sad tale. After reading it I can understand where the term ""Kafkaesque"" came from."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 17, 2013","Read on the recommendation of a list of classics from high school that you should re-read (2 down 8 to go!). Entertaining. Compact. While the absurdity of the premise does not necessarily have the same impact on the modern reader (or anyone who has seen ""Being John Malkovich"" or anything like that), I think it can be appreciated for its historical context. If nothing else I feel re-reading gives me license to liberally use the phrase ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 18, 2021",A classic introduction to the world of Kafkas works and to the expression ''Kafkaesque''.
The Metamorphosis,4,"February 18, 2025","Poor Gregor Samsa, all that suffering just cause you had 6 legs. Kafka really bugged me with this one, transforming what could have been a quirky tale into a Kafkaesque nightmare. If his aim was to turn my understanding of self and suffering inside out, then he succeeded beyond measure."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 22, 2008","I had to read this to be able to place all the literary, film, and cultural references to Kafka's 'Metamorphosis'that I keep running into. It's a novela, quite funny, and a quick read. Interestingly enough, my next book was 'The History of Love' which is extremely Kafkaesque and has references to the metamorphosis."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 12, 2012","I've never really comprehended the full definition of the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" until I read this book, which is a compilation of Kafka's stories. But even until then, there are more ways than one to define what ""Kafkaesque-ism"" really means."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 31, 2015",Much of those strong emotions are played in a story about Gregor Samsa who woke up one day tragically transformed into a monster like cockroach an allegory of bed ridden illness and the colossal asshole treatment from his family in the wake; of such epic fuckery that I was left kafkaesque-ly scarred.
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 22, 2015","Nothing much to add here - if an author gets an adjective in his name, then my 2 cents aren't going to be of much value. These stories, somehow, end up being more Kafkaesque than I imagined - especially the beginning of A Country Doctor, which is worse than I remember. The Stoker is odd, and In the Penal Colony remains one of my favorite short stories."
The Metamorphosis,3,"April 2, 2014","I'm not sure, having read this that when I say Kafkaesque I mean what I think I mean, though it was certainly a bizarre nightmarish world. It reminded me very much of my friend Belgin's writing. I think I'm returning to the mundane for a while now. Back to post Katrina New Orleans and then maybe a little Tudor mystery. This, whilst good needs to be in small doses."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 7, 2016","Very interesting take on the man turned monster story. There is no glamour in this story. The subject is pathetic and loathed and the short story ends with a whimper. Kind of neat. Guess that's why they have the term Kafkaesque. The loneliness, inadequacy, meaninglessness and absurdity of the situation and characters is truly a head scratcher and leaves you impressed with the work."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 17, 2016","Finally! I can use with authority the term kafkaesque. So many people suffer the hideous isolation of Gregor Samsa without converting to a grotesque bug. Forgotten and abhorred for becoming different- or was he always different? - wounded mentally and physically he withers into forgotten obscurity. No ceremony, no funeral procession. How many people have felt this way?"
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 18, 2016","There is a reason that ""kafkaesque"" means ""surreal."" The short stories in this book (""The Metamorphosis"" is the most famous) read like dreams/nightmares you would have after eating ham and sauerkraut pizza immediately before bed. I enjoyed their strangeness and trying to figure out what point (if any) Kafka was trying to make in them."
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 15, 2018","My introduction to Kafka. I'd be interested in reading more. I finally understand the term ""Kafkaesque."""
The Metamorphosis,5,"April 22, 2021","This short story was one of the biggest surprises for me. Everyone said it's really good and they were right, this is a masterpiece. Kafka manages to hit the subconscious strings to depict the pure despair of... kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 4, 2023","While the beginning was absurdist and what many would characterise as Kafkaesque, the third chapter was the most sad and poignant."
The Metamorphosis,4,"January 1, 2013","This story is full of layers of symbolism about the human condition and clearly is one of the most important novel(las) of the 20th century, thing I found myself a bit bored at times. I probably should have read it more carefully. On the plus side, I now know what kafkaesque means."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 23, 2024",It was actually really interesting to read The Metamorphosis along with a handful of Kafka's other works. I now more than ever understand the term Kafkaesque. What a strange soul. Josephine and The Mouse People was my favorite.
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 25, 2015","Kafkaesque writing, especially in this short novella, is especially interesting. The concept and the style, mood and tone, made with the writings, binds this short story to be both fascinating and rather eerie. It is original and unique, which makes it more of a great story."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 29, 2015",Very Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 10, 2017",very Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 17, 2019",damn this book is ... the only word i can describe is kafkaesque. dry absurd.
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 14, 2020","Poor well-meaning Gregor and his pretty despicable family, who are after all only human (unlike Gregor by the time we meet him). Metaphorical; a tale to draw your own conclusions from and of course Kafkaesque by definition haha."

The Metamorphosis,4,"June 5, 2022","Felt like a lot of metaphors probably went over my head. But definitely enjoyed the philosophical aspects of the story. Also, just sorta a wacky concept and I liked that. Warning, you might get obsessed with saying ""Kafkaesque""..."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 5, 2022","Thought after all these years I should read this guy. I can see where the term ""Kafkaesque"" comes from! It certainly is powerful thought- provoking stuff. Not to mention dark and weird as well. Glad to have read it but."
The Metamorphosis,4,"September 3, 2007","I think I read this so I could use Kafkaesque in a sentence without feeling like a fraud... It didn't work. The book depressed the hell out of me though, so there's that."
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 17, 2007",So Kafkaesque...
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 27, 2007",What to know what Kafkaesque means? This is the benchmark story! A boy slowly turns into a bug while stuck in a room in his parent house. An interesting read.
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 12, 2008",kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis,4,"May 4, 2009",Having Kafka read to you amid the din of early morning traffic is nearly as weird as are his stories. Kafkaesque!

The Metamorphosis,4,"April 16, 2010",Kafkaesque!!! no need to say anything else
The Metamorphosis,5,"November 10, 2010","Kafka is strange and wonderful. He almost created the idea of modern angst. One of the few authors to have a writing style named after him... ""Kafkaesque"""
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 9, 2011",It's just so... Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,5,"September 29, 2012",Probably the best story I've read so far.. Engaging on how the kafkaesque aspects of the story tie together with Gregor's realisation of how insignificant yet important he is.
The Metamorphosis,4,"March 15, 2012","Finally I have read a book by Kafka, and understand better what ""kafkaesque"" means. Really enjoyed all the stories."
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 16, 2012","Encompasses the sadness in routine and literally the most depressing book I've ever read. Still, very true to emotions and always easy to relate to. Kafkaesque at its best."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"September 24, 2012",sometimes life gets so crazy that it can only be kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"December 19, 2012","It's a classic. A weird story, of course, not to be taken literally. At least I now know what is meant by Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,2,"June 14, 2013",Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 25, 2013","Read it. Its only 50 pages and then you can say you've read Kafka. Of course now every time someone says something is Kafkaesque, I assume someone is talking about bugs."
The Metamorphosis,4,"November 18, 2015","Worth reading just for the sake of understanding the word ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,4,"April 23, 2014",Kafka is Kafkaesque as ever. A bizarre story of a bizarre transformation. But the emotions captured by Kafka around this narration make it one of a kind. Kafka I am eternally your fan.
The Metamorphosis,1,"February 22, 2015","Wait, so this guy earned an eponymous adjective? For me, ""Kafkaesque"" now means dull and bleak. Bleh - I'd rather spend my time on other things."
The Metamorphosis,5,"March 30, 2015",I'm unsure if I like Kafkaesque material. The absurdity is slightly overwhelming. The ending is also heart breaking
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 7, 2015",The common man's Bible. Truly Kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis,3,"August 19, 2015",Very very weird... Kafkaesque is you will
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 12, 2016",My life is a mixture of kafkaesque moments.
The Metamorphosis,5,"December 12, 2015","The Metamorphosis (Die Verwandlung) is a great work that takes you to the kafkaesque reality, not through his pen but through the mind, and the very existence, of Kafka."
The Metamorphosis,4,"December 29, 2015",Finally understood what Kafkaesque means. This story was so bizarre. Sad but understandably so... Totally worth the read.
The Metamorphosis,3,"July 5, 2016",Thought provoking novel by Kafka....quintessentially kafkaesque.....a good read
The Metamorphosis,4,"August 27, 2016","In this book, Kafka described the sensation of 'suffering' in a graphical and absurd (Kafkaesque) manner."
The Metamorphosis,3,"September 10, 2016","This is his second work i read after The Trial, and not enough Kafkaesque for me. Still liked the way Kafka handles the subject and its ability to be interpreted in various ways."
The Metamorphosis,5,"October 9, 2016","Wait what. So this is ""kafkaesque""? Hi, Peculiar. You're odd and wonderful. And odd. You blew my mind to bits."

The Metamorphosis,5,"August 15, 2019","This is the edition I have. Spooky, love these weird little stories. Very ( dare I?) Kafkaesque."
The Metamorphosis,3,"November 9, 2019","Truly ""Kafkaesque"" as one would say. Also, this one was way better than the last book we had to read for German sooo yeaahh, there's that."
The Metamorphosis,4,"June 27, 2024",Very Kafkaesque!
The Metamorphosis,5,"August 13, 2021",had to reread.. again… don’t think u guys really get it *puts art student hat on* this is so kafkaesque..
The Metamorphosis,4,"July 4, 2021",I had a Kafka book of aphorisms I got from an old bookstore and had an instant connection. I feel relief that the unusualness (or kAfKaEsQue) of life was able to be written so bluntly. That's all.

The Metamorphosis,3,"February 9, 2023",The trial was great. What a great concept and the best way to explain Kafkaesque. Metamorphosis was far more absurdist and I didn't get into it half as much.

The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"February 3, 2017","Surreal yet sad tale of change not accepted. Given the current state of world affairs..the term ""Kafkaesque"" Will be in the vocabulary of more in the near future..."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"April 1, 2017","Franz Kafka is popular for his books like The Trial, and The Metamorphosis. In his books he paints a world where people are mistreated because of the way society operates. In The Trial the main character is forced to go through a Trial in which he doesn’t understand the judicial proceedings, and in The Metamorphosis the stress of modern life becomes so much for Gregor Samsa, that he turns into an insect. Because of his works, Kafka got a word named after him. Kafkaesque is a word referring to hard, complicated, and frustrating experiences, like the DMV. Kafka himself was no stranger to hard, complicated and frustrating experiences. Afterall, he worked in law and was Jewish in a time when Anti-Semitism wasn’t uncommon. Kafka may not have been a famous writer in his time, but has become popular in the modern day for his disturbing critiques of society."
The Metamorphosis,5,"May 28, 2017","Xuất sắc một cách khó tin, mọi thứ đều tuyệt vời và ổn định. Nó ám ảnh đủ như mình mong muốn trước khi đọc, dị đủ như thứ mình cần. Nó kiểu Kafkaesque mẫu mực còn hơn cả Lâu đài nữa. Từ Rừng Na Uy mình mới đọc một cuốn xuất sắc như vậy cũng khá lâu rồi."
The Metamorphosis,Not rated,"May 14, 2018","A story that starts with a nightmare and ends in despair, shrouded in absurdity and abstract symbolism, it is the very definition of the word ""Kafkaesque""."
The Metamorphosis,3,"March 18, 2019","Maybe one day I will fully understand the term ""Kafkaesque."""
Existentialism is a Humanism,4,"May 22, 2024","This idea does not offer much comfort during hardship. When I feel abysmal and defeated, in terms of existentialism, it is I that brought myself there and it is I that chooses to remain there. For existentialism, it is impossible to place any blame on anyone else, regardless of the circumstances. This idea is apparent in some of my favorite literature, i.e., The Trial. Josef K. is put on a trial without being told his crime--the novel catalogues how he navigates it. It is not the trial itself that defines K., or is it really the purpose of the book--although The Trial offers the novel structure and conflict, the Kafka's novel could care less about the actual workings of the trial, and instead, focuses on K. Despite his existential and (of course) Kafkaesque circumstances, K. is examined by the readers through how he lives, what he thinks, by what he does, etc. So, despite variables outside his control, The Trial magnifies how a person is still responsible for themselves. And that, at least, gives me comfort. I am brought peace through the idea that wherever I am, whoever I'm with, whatever I am involved in, I am still in control and I can still shape the essence that is me."
the ocean at the end of the lane,3,"October 5, 2014","I was unfamiliar with Neil Gaiman before this book so I had no expectations. I wasn't expecting a story so filled with childhood fantasy. I didn't realize it's really more young adult fiction. As I got through more of it, it reminded me of a Harry Potter-like story. The Kafkaesque situation with the new 'child-minder' was really gripping and uncomfortable, like being in a dream with events that you have no power to affect. That was the most powerful part of the book for me, but it didn't hold me equally throughout. I probably won't read another by Gaiman because it's not one of my preferred genres."
the ocean at the end of the lane,4,"August 7, 2013","Kafkaesque, Alice In Wonderland-y."
parallel stories,3,"August 31, 2014","Finally, what is an appropriate reading strategy for this sprawling Kafkaesque work? I suggest bleeping over the many parts that are offensive, just getting the general idea of why they are there. Read at night, think in the morning."
Diaries 1910 1923,3,"October 26, 2011","Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was a Jew born to German-speaking parents in Prague. His works are so brilliant that they seem to be eternal and the term kafkaesque has been coined to describe the something that is characteristic of him or his works. Who are these authors whose names had to be immortalized in the English dictionary? 
  ballardian – adj. resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in Ballard’s novels and stories, esp. dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes, and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments."
Diaries 1910 1923,5,"September 1, 2013","The diaries are not easy to read, that must be cleared out. They demand fierce strength and above all, patience with the tormented writer. The many depressing paragraphs can wear one down at times. Yet these diaries deserve careful reading by anyone seriously interested in literature, the mind of a genius, and the origin of anything Kafkaesque."
Diaries 1910 1923,2,"July 25, 2014","I read most of this, although not in chronological order. I probably missed some but I don't feel like it matters. I can't say I loved this. It is of course Kafkaesque. Generally he wrote in his journal in an extremely disjointed manner, mostly when he was miserable. A lot of it is hard to understand. It is probably a lot like your own journals and diaries....you don't want to read those either. I can't say that I recommend anyone read this...unless you have a serious popstar-like Kafka crush."
Diaries 1910 1923,4,"June 10, 2025","Kafka possessed a mind like no other, and these diary entries, written while he was busy composing masterpieces such as AMERIKA and THE TRIAL, give glimpses into a mind that could not, and did not, distinguish between life, fiction, dreams and terrors. Women entice and terrify him, a notion conveyed with exquisite guilt in ""The Metamorphoses"". He fears dying and yet is strangely silent when tuberculosis finally consumes him. Kafka was not political, and still he gets caught up in the wave of patriotic fervor when the Austro-Hungarian empire went to war in 1914, and his attempt to enlist is curiously comic, in the manner of his Austrian contemporary Adolf Hitler. These diaries provide a personal peek at a world on the verge of volcanic extinction and, just like Kafkaesque fiction, a foreshadowing of the horrors to come in post-war, post-Kafka, 1923 Europe."

The Unbearable Lightness of Being,3,"June 12, 2025","Anyway Kundera has a really cool way of putting a name to thoughts we’ve all probably had but never confronted, since they’re more so threads that usually hang in the background of our consciousness. Like his constant dwelling on how small coincidences can change a life and even history. And how abstract any judgment we can make about anything, really, is, even when it comes to our own decisions. We can’t know whether we made the correct decision; we don’t have a parallel universe in which we chose differently to compare to. In these ways there were several moments in the book where the narrator felt like a voice speaking from one’s own subconscious, which I think is really rare. I also loved the Kafkaesque blending of dreams and reality throughout, specifically the part where Tomas directed Teresa to walk up a hill, where she found a firing squad that had been waiting for her and others who had scheduled their suicide, and who refused to kill her after she revealed it wasn’t her decision. It even made me wonder if this was just her dream or a sudden dark turn. The ending was beautiful and bittersweet, but unsatisfactory in terms of Tomas’s character development."
The Unbearable Lightness of Being,5,"July 23, 2023","In conclusion, I held a skepticism through most of the first half of this novel but was won over and by the end astounded. It is a literary masterpiece and left me looking at the world from a new perspective. I felt changed for the better. The Kafkaesque dramatic style, symbolism, often poetic language, the art on art staccato,the way time spirals(going back and forth); couple this with the frequent philosophical profundity and immersive psychological perspectives and you have a deftly constructed and well-rounded whole. As mentioned in my introduction, I considered Kundera's 'Life is Elsewhere' one of my all-time favourite novels and after reading this I now consider Kundera one of my all-time favourite writers."
The Unbearable Lightness of Being,3,"November 5, 2022","The ideas behind the book are great, but it’s not executed well. Kafkaesque in a bad way."
The Unbearable Lightness of Being,5,"October 16, 2024","There are many such ideas throughout the book which if unchecked can entice one into long hours of rumination. Ideas on life, love, longing for paradise, religion, compassion, revolution, Kafkaesque life under authoritarian regimes, and so on. All of which are brought out, dissected, and built upon around the lives of three main characters: Tomas, Terza, and Sabina (a love triangle… sort of) living in Prague during the Russian invasion of Czech Republic."
The Unbearable Lightness of Being,3,"July 11, 2015","For all that I was expecting of Kundera, I have to say, I was quite disappointed. This book, while filled with well constructed characters, is written as psychological exposition. A book which has to write so openly, so blatantly about a characters thoughts seems to me much less interesting than one which lets its characters be discovered in and through their action and reaction. I would say it better to fall on the exact other side, the Kafkaesque side which makes opaque and interesting. Kundera has thought a lot about his characters, he should just write about them less like case studies."
The Unbearable Lightness of Being,4,"September 20, 2023",Kafkaesque possibly not because it’s absurd but because it’s at times crushingly real/depressing
Sense and Sensibility,3,"December 19, 2017","There's no doubt that modern feminists see more clearly in finding S&amp;S a systemic critique of British gender and economic inequality. Indeed, at it's finest, there is something Kafkaesque or Orwellian about the struggles of Elinor and Marianne to figure out what the hell is going on with all the confusing social maneuvers beyond their ken, and their struggles to secure their own happiness are always constrained by the more ruthless or callous machinations of strangers. If ""sense"" is economic realpolitik, then the most sensible characters in the novel are the conniving Lucy and the various unpitying matrons playing chess with young people's lives. Elinor cannot compete with such reasonable viciousness."
Paths of Glory,5,"June 18, 2010","Forgotten classic (is that an oxymoron?)from 1935. Horrifying Kafkaesque vision of war, inspired by the true story of four French soldiers executed for mutiny in WWI. They were exonerated after their deaths. A vivid, well-written account of the trenches by a veteran."
conversations with friends,4,"September 6, 2023","I live in a communist country that feels like a Kafkaesque/Orwellian hell, so no, Bobbi, depression is not just a response to the conditions of late capitalism. No, Frances, being opposed to authority figures is not communist intuition, in fact if you find something conflicting you have to shut up and bite your tongue."
conversations with friends,4,"August 17, 2021","What is doubly interesting however, is the contrast between the realness of the psychology and inner lives of the characters and the surrealness of their decisions. Their decisions and the responses that transpire from these decisions is a Kafkaesque mirage. More than a few occasions I found myself confused as to exactly why they do what they do, often questioning if this kind of behaviour does happen in real life. I haven’t quite figured out yet how this surrealness fits into the meaning of everything. Maybe I just haven’t yet matured enough to understand the questionable decisions of these characters that this lack of experience has manifested in myself as confusion. But I have some suspicions that Sally Rooney was intentional on the surrealness. Regardless, I’ve never read something so grounded and yet so surreal at the same time, which makes the novel all the more interesting. Perhaps degradation comes with it a natural surrealness is what Sally Rooney is trying to say. But I am not quite sure."
Revolutionary Road,5,"July 3, 2013","It is easy to focus on the gut-wrenching troubles in April and Franks relationship. They are in a difficult situation, no doubt about it. It was hard to watch them suffer and yet I might conclude that the descriptions of Frank’s work were even more harrowing for me. Moving papers from one stack to another in an attempt to avoid any real work is an exercise in slow, subtle demoralization. Yates portrays a wicked, Kafkaesque picture of corporate America. Again, I see a subtle quality of blaming the environment for his unhappiness here, but I understand the tendency and the sentiment. It seems a familiar approach of our society. Lets sit back and smartly bitch about everything but not actually do anything about it."

y n,2,"August 3, 2023","It was interesting to begin with: the narrator is a Korean-American woman adrift in Berlin, working as a copywriter for a company selling canned artichoke hearts. She is an intellectual wasting her creative potential on ""credibly infus[ing] the vegetable with the ability to feel romantic love for its consumer""; she is a lover caught up in her sort-of-boyfriend's vocal inability to fall in love with her. She doesn't care for K-Pop, low-brow as it seems to be — until she does. Obsession comes fast with The Pack of Boys, and hers finds its object in Moon, the youngest member of the band (apparently modelled on the figure of Jimin from BTS). When she starts writing y/n fiction about him, it is out of a sublime sense of connection and transcendence, but reality and fiction have to come together somewhere. As y/n moves to Seoul to be with Moon, our narrator too takes a trip to South Korea to find him, to face him at last — her idol. The rest is pure chaos, an overwrought piece of satire with the occasional glimmer of the Kafkaesque."
y n,5,"December 21, 2022","The novel has a very surreal, Kafkaesque vibe. The language is ostentatious and an experience to read in itself. The narrative is disjointed and fragmented and you never know quite what’s happening and then you suddenly find your bearing only to lose it again."
y n,Not rated,"June 18, 2025","Wow!! This is the only book I read, a part from Kafka himself, that I would call kafkaesque. I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews calling it pretentious and weird, bc as surrealist and experimental as it was, I thought it was brilliant and really really enjoyed it."
y n,4,"January 24, 2023","What also appeals to me are the conversations about going all-in to achieve your dreams, regardless of the nature of the dream in question. The main character is guided to persevere no matter what. On her journey, she meets a group of eccentric people, all with their own passions. Their encounters (called Kafkaesque in the blurb) broaden the scope of the novel and draw attention to things happening in society."
y n,3,"May 20, 2024","The book summary described a Korean-American woman (living in Germany) who flies to Seoul to find the K-pop idol she is obsessed with. Intrigued, I imagined a quest trope. Instead, this book is rather Kafkaesque, dealing with themes like obsession and fandom."
y n,3,"July 15, 2025","This story’s unnamed narrator is a Korean-American precariously employed copywriter who is living in Berlin with her boyfriend Masterson and his milieu of expat graduate students and bores. A chance trip to see the pack of boys perform in concert leaves her obsessed with one of their idols, Moon. She explores this feverish obsession through compulsive consumption of his livestreams and public image, buying all the way into his incoherent messages that are part new-age spiritualism, part positive psychology, and cloying attempts at evoking a commercialised sense of community. Then she turns to fan-fiction, writing long and twisted stories of her own interactions with Moon through the guise of the Y/N format. When Moon abruptly retires from public life, she upends her life to travel to South Korea seeking to meet him for reasons that are not entirely transparent even, we suspect, to herself. Entering a Kafkaesque world of neoliberal Seoul, she soon has the edges of her identity challenged and aimlessly shuffles her way through an eerie landscape that is both full of signs and absent of meaning. When she finally, through a series of doubtful events, ends up with access to the band’s headquarters and later to a strange liminal location where Moon himself is said to reside, she gets her chance to finally confront him and her own intentions for him."

y n,3,"December 1, 2023","a really uncanny kafkaesque exploration of parasociality, idolatry, and obsession constructed with the skeleton of og fan fic writing, whose premise alone was sufficiently charming enough for me to keep reading."
y n,4,"September 13, 2023","My big problem with a lot of contemporary lit is it feels like it’s trying so hard to be something that it loses its point in telling a story. For example, the blurb describes Polygon Plaza as “kafkaesque”; things like this give the impression of drawing people in with what other writers have accomplished, and it put me off. But naturally I didn’t let one word of the blurb stop me, and I’m glad I stuck with it. I always appreciate a short read, and it was very fun. :-)"
y n,3,"June 20, 2023",I'm not entirely sure what to make of this if I'm honest. I felt further and further out of my comfort zone as I progressed through the book. The main character is so fractured that I felt that I never really got a handle on her and it was hard for me to feel any empathy with her. It was a very Kafkaesque experience of extreme fandom.
y n,4,"March 26, 2024","This wasn’t what I expected it to be. In the beginning I felt confused, irritated and outright frustrated but once I allowed myself to fall into the story, I became mesmerized by the writing and attention to detail. A kafkaesque fever dream is exactly what I would describe this book to be. A contemplation on obsession, identity and connection."
y n,4,"October 18, 2023","Slight star inflation here but this book was impressively original. Usually when people describe something as Kafkaesque it's an exaggeration but this is a perfect description in this case. Unnerving, bizarre, disturbing, and very cool. Excessively wierd and dense? Probably."

In the Penal Colony,5,"November 27, 2024","The particularly Kafkaesque elements are that the condemned man never knows his crime. It is a trumped up charge of ""insubordination and insulting a senior officer"", which arises from a pointless job at which success is almost impossible: he fell asleep, so failed to salute the (sleeping) captain's door on the hour, every hour, through the night."
In the Penal Colony,5,"June 1, 2025","The very last words of In the Penal Colony move across my bewildered eyes, sitting in the Kafkaesque corner of my apartment, I feel numb since words refuse to come to my observant mind, the comatose feeling blinds my consciousness which fails to pick up words from cerebral saucepan. The prophetic fable of Kafka is full of Kafkaesque elements which would provide eerie dizzying delight to his fans. Set in a remote colonial outpost, it shows a state executioner demonstrating a dilapidated, death-dealing machine, which graphically inscribes the prisoner's sentence on his skin, to a bemused visitor."
In the Penal Colony,4,"May 5, 2023","Kafka never fails to impress me. Strange, disturbing and fascinating. A visitor visits a penal colony to witness a demonstration of a strange and bloody punishment/torture method. The ""executioner"" presents his work with pride and serenity, in contrast with the barbaric procedure. The narrator also seems to be detached by the horror he describes. The usual Kafkaesque nonsensical world is present here as well together with themes of injustice, suppression, liberalism vs authoritarian society. Gory, stifling atmosphere."
In the Penal Colony,5,"May 9, 2023","Torture porn of the kafkaesque variety: A highly renowned explorer visits an island in order to do research on its peculiar legal system which revolves around an elaborate, monstruous execution machine that inscribes the (declared) wrongdoings of the condemned deeper and deeper into his skin until, after hours of torture, he finally dies. The officer who demonstrates the device to the explorer aims to convince him of the advantages and importance of the traditional machine which was designed and built by his old commander - the new commander, on the other hand, seems to be more sketipcal of its value. To underline his point, the officer makes the person who should be executed get out of the machine again and lets himself be strapped onto it - and then things get out of control..."
In the Penal Colony,5,"October 11, 2018","Kafka is hard enough for me when I read him in my native language, let alone in German. And I'm not talking about the difficulties of reading in a foreign language, no. Although my German is definitely to be improved, this was not the problem. But I think that when you read him in the original the feelings created, that powerful sense of anguish and suffocation is magnified. The rhythm is steadier and the Kafkaesque absurdity more intense, I think."
In the Penal Colony,5,"February 6, 2018","I recently finished the series ""Breaking Bad,"" on Netflix. In one of the episodes the word ""Kafkaesque"" surfaces in the dialogue. The word also reads as the title of the episode. This set me searching for a meaning. I've read two shorts by Kafka before this one, but this fulfills the description of Kafkaesque for me. The story brings elements of shock, psychological manipulation of the reader, violence, blood, gore. I loved it. Kind of creepy but true. I begin to discover and enjoy the mind of Kafka."
In the Penal Colony,5,"May 21, 2020","This is such a dark story, definitely Kafkaesque! In an unnamed island penal colony a traveler is given an explanation of the workings of a torture/execution machine by an officer who is a fierce believer in this form of punishment. It goes in a direction I didn’t expect. This story is referenced in Murakami’s Kafka on the shore, where the boy who calls himself Kafka says this story is his favourite and that it is more than an allegory for life but a description of life itself. Ooh, even darker!"
In the Penal Colony,4,"July 29, 2023","It is so much fun to call things Kafkaesque, and at every opportunity, I will be glad to reference this unique aura that is present in Franz Kafka's work. Every piece of writing that I've read from him so far has had a similar surreal, odd, and almost claustrophobic mood, and ""In the Penal Colony"" was no exception."
In the Penal Colony,4,"June 18, 2020","The influence of Schopenhauer brilliantly shines throughout. Pain is what pushes one to the threshold of enlightenment. Pain is what makes the eyes glitter, and veils the face with a mystic haze of ecstacy. Insight and death go hand in hand, and transfiguration is the reward of those undergoing torture. The machine was a work of art. Deleuze didn't call Kafka the prophet of distributed cybernetic power that is typical of Control Societies, for nothing. A Kafkaesque Control Society which operates not on external surveillance but on internal policing. The Officer was the epitome of this kind of mentality, it was almost prophetic. This is how our capitalist society functions today."
In the Penal Colony,5,"February 28, 2012","The Penal Colony ('In der Strafkolonie') is a very well-known, popular short story from Kafka. Although perhaps a bit more over-the-top than his other stories, The Penal Colony has all the Kafkaesque element one would expect: a detached narrator, omnipotent horror, deathly irony, et cetera."
In the Penal Colony,2,"March 27, 2017","Probably, if I was not that scared of the aftertaste of In the Penal Colony, I would easily give it full stars. But how it goes? Many a time I wanted to vomit, many a time I wanted to sneak the book to the hell, many a time I wanted to switch to the reading of mirth and joy instead of this absurd story. The theme of the short story is in the same Kafkaesque mood, yet it involves the scenes of blood and cruelty. I would not recommend it to any of my friends, especially to female fellas — how I dare to destroy, consciously to their unconsciousness, the optimism of my surroundings?"
In the Penal Colony,5,"May 23, 2024","A foreign traveler meets the new captain of soldiers on an island infamous for its penal colony, I found myself immersing in the feeling of reading to Edgar Allan Poe infused with Kafkaesque philosophy— the book is a philosophical horror delving into the depths of human nature’s capacity for justification and normalization of atrocities."
In the Penal Colony,5,"January 6, 2022","Kafka's ""In the Penal Colony"" is a true testament to his genius, and is probably the most 'Kafkaesque' out of all his books that I've read."
In the Penal Colony,5,"November 15, 2015","Anyway—there is no doubt in my mind that Kafka’s legacy was cemented with The Metamorphosis, and from which the term Kafkaesque arose, which seems to me to be misapplied as much as not. That story is surely the one most readers are acquainted with, and I found it still affecting, thirty some years after the first time I read it. But either because of familiarity with that story, or just that I’m in a different stage of life, I thought The Penal Colony was far and away more affecting. Not that that means I had a lot of success deciphering it—in a way, it reminded me of the play Oedipus Tyrannus, in that it left me slightly bewildered as to where the story’s power came from, even though it was deeply stirring. Some commentary I read on The Penal Colony made much of the religious symbolism in the story, which is definitely there, though it seemed to me that Kafka succeeded somehow despite some of this symbolism, which, by the end, is almost ham-handed."
In the Penal Colony,4,"April 18, 2020","Franz kafka will always be a mystery to me.The Kafkaesque paradox always fascinates and bites me at the same time.Philosophical interpretation with horrified sociological environment explains the profound truth of human nature.This short story gave some new intellectual things to ponder about.After reading this story,i think kafka was deeply influenced by Dostoevsky's suffering and redemption dogma.While i have come to know that suffering is the part and parcel of human life."

In the Penal Colony,5,"August 16, 2013","Kafka's works illustrate the estrangement and absurdity of German expressionist literature, and like most works of literature, they are better in their original language. What really amazes me is how Kafka works have permeated into modern culture, and so many things are downright kafkaesque. References have even crept into sports, whereby (as part of a spoof) in an attempt to have new fan appreciation days, Kafka Day, would lure fans into a stadium, in which no game would actually be played, and all exits being barred and locked, with no one being able leave. This might go on for hours or days, and just as frustration and anger become intolerable, the gates would be opened, with all fans receiving a team attired Kafka bobble-head doll as they exit."
In the Penal Colony,3,"May 3, 2017","Kafka can be quite hard to follow. The tales of this book remind me of the concept of ""stream of conciousness"" and while the stories deal with the Kafkaesque (?) subjects of the man crashing against the absurdity of the system, I found them very difficult to surf on that stream."

In the Penal Colony,4,"July 16, 2018","In the penal colony... or when Kafka got gory, is both very Kafka-like while being his least kafkaesque tale. Indeed, that apparatus might have been appropriated in one of Stephen king’s novels somewhere. While the tale is allegorical like most Kafka tales - it makes you think of someone, somewhere, in similar situation and Give you a perspective that you just didn’t have before. There is also ample amount of unexplained mystery and an ending which might have turned the tale on its head. Or it might not have, depending on the perspective you lean towards. But it forces you to think about those perspectives. Still, the tale is also fairly literal and a swathe of it is exposition on the brutality of happenings, or rather a specific happening, in the penal colony. In that, Kafka sheds his compulsion to zoom in on details in the narrative that do a lot to add mystique, but do not necessarily move the story forward, even though they really are a part of the story. Except, perhaps, in the penal colony is nothing but one giant zoom-in on the apparatus, and then the ending. Ugh. I am rambling, aren’t I?"
In the Penal Colony,4,"July 13, 2017","All in all, I can highly recommend this as one of Kafka's finest works. It's also by far the easiest to read, and the least absurdly Kafkaesque one, so it might work well as an introduction to his writings for newcomers."
In the Penal Colony,4,"May 17, 2024","to keep it short and sweet, just like kafka did in this short story, this piece is intriguing and i saw it as a refresher. it’s undoubtedly ‘kafkaesque’"
In the Penal Colony,3,"December 10, 2024",Religiously Kafkaesque
In the Penal Colony,4,"June 10, 2024","This book, a short story really, is one of the reading tips I gleaned from Richard Flanagan’s “Question 7” (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). Actually I had read “In the Penal Colony” (which is literally what the original German title means) before, but it was many years ago and I didn’t remember much about it. I read a lot of Kafka in my youth and I’d almost forgotten what an impressive writer he was. His stories always manage to conjure up that unique ambiance, somehow weirdly threatening and mysterious, but beautiful at the same time, although they’re written in straightforward and fairly simple language. It’s difficult to describe: I guess that’s why they coined the word “kafkaesque”!"
In the Penal Colony,4,"October 10, 2024","All in all, the story explores the themes of injustice and the justification for brutal punishment, a familiar Kafkaesque environment. But the difference with this story is in this one the crime of the Condemned Man is clearly described, although a very minor one (a soldier must stand up for 12 hours in guarding a door and saluting the Commander but he fell asleep), which is not at all worthy of a torturous death."
In the Penal Colony,5,"August 9, 2023","it's in a summary a very uncomfortable book focusing very much on the topic of punishment. the lack of a judicary system reminded me very strongly of the trial and it has the strong imprint of Kafka on it. souless, obsessive characters and an air of mystery concerning the previous commander all make it very... kafkaesque."
In the Penal Colony,4,"July 12, 2021",It was a short but fun read which teleports you into yet another Kafkaesque world.
In the Penal Colony,3,"February 21, 2025","Apart from being hopelessly bleak, there is a sparse, dry quality to the construction of his stories that detaches you from Kafka's words and plunges you into the morbid (for lack of a better, distinct, descriptive term) Kafkaesque dream."
In the Penal Colony,5,"April 29, 2022","Extremely Kafka, I think it would be a great introduction to him (better than The Metamorphosis or Trial). I say this only having read metamorphosis and then like 2/3 of the trial. But from this you can get a pretty good grasp of his major themes, philosophy, and also what 'kafkaesque' means--wow fancy word! If you're looking to read Kafka just so you can say kafkaesque comfortably this would probably suffice. His novels (IMO) can get a little bit tedious at times (hence me not finishing the trial...yet), but this is well-paced and to the point. And not to mention a very good story. Like really really good."
In the Penal Colony,Not rated,"December 18, 2024","halfway through reading this, I started writing something strange, somnambulant, set in a world that bears a resemblance to our own but which is undeniably uncanny, revealing of the psychological dimensions underpinning social institutions—kafkaesque, I can now say."
In the Penal Colony,4,"January 9, 2023","As Kafkaesque as Kafka gets I think. Such a brilliant commentary on the transience of justice and fairness. So brutal it had my heart racing when nothing was really happening; couldn’t put it down. The writing is as beautiful and as enticing as I imagined. Despite being so short, Kafka manages to humanise each and every character, bringing them to life. A great prediction (or early study?) of the totalitarianism that overtook the European countries soon after the publishing of the book. Where the quote of “guilt is always beyond doubt” originates from!"
In the Penal Colony,4,"January 1, 2018","It's difficult to put my thumb on what exactly I liked about this story. I've not previously read Kafka and didn't think about the adjective ""Kafkaesque,"" so I went into this with a blank slate. Things I enjoyed: the manic obsession of the Officer with regard to his machine, the later antics between the Soldier and the Condemned Man and the abrupt ending without any definite resolution."
In the Penal Colony,5,"February 5, 2024","A real kafkaesque experience. A stoic and morally uninhabited stranger thrown into a strange circumstance as an onlooker or an agent. And he takes the logical and morally centered approach. As a reader, it is mesmerizing to read the thoughts of another played out, the antagonist is brilliant and affluent. Great read"

In the Penal Colony,3,"March 3, 2025","It was interesting, but I'm not sure if I'd like this as much if it had some other author's name on it. Exploration of how a bureaucratic system can become dehumanising and evil is nice. This is the prose i bring up when trying to explain what Kafkaesque means. He knows how to turn a simple looking idea into something disturbing."
In the Penal Colony,5,"November 2, 2015","Nothing really whacks your brain left, right and centre while humming a mellifluous lullaby like a Franz Kafka novella. In a matter of fifty-odd pages, you emerge from the dungeon of frozen emptiness a broken beaten man having felt every last atom of serenity drain away from your body and replaced with a million pointy questions pinching every inch of your mind, which, no matter where you look and whom you ask, are met with just one answer: ""It’s Kafkaesque!” And you despair! Oh how you despair! What does it mean? What does it all mean? Surely it has to mean something?"
In the Penal Colony,3,"May 3, 2023","i have mixed feelings! usually collections don’t agree with me because i naturally enjoy some stories more than others. this was the case here. i really struggled to get through some of the shorter, less important ones and this was mainly the reason why it took me so long to read this. on the other hand, “metamorphosis” and “the penal colony” were fascinating and my favorite by far. i at least now know what is meant by “kafkaesque” and that is the perfect outcome to me"
In the Penal Colony,5,"May 13, 2014","Or, am I (the reader) that one condemned man? A man who was ignorant of the premonition that was looming before him. A man who was not even given chance to defend against the charges, which were again unknown for him. Aren't we, in this world, get engulfed in such Kafkaesque surrealism? And the same condemned man became sadist as soon as he was free and empowered. Isn't it the way we behave, animalistic somewhere deep down?"
In the Penal Colony,4,"September 17, 2021","A collection of all the stories he published in his lifetime. Most of them are vignettes of the type a very introverted person would compose. Just musings on thoughts. The earlier stories are very much this. Not worth mentioning. The Metamorphosis remains his best piece—his most accessible and the most intentional work in which he doesn’t simply muse on an idea or an observation, but has a story to tell, and it’s deeply personal. Another highlight is A Country Doctor, which is absurd and memorable—the very definition of “Kafkaesque” and clearly showing the inspiration for a lot of other works (Stranger on the Loose) I’ve read over the years. A Dream, and The Bucket Rider are also standouts, delivering that particular sense of surrealism which has inspired generations of writers in the century since they were first published. I enjoyed In The Penal Colony as a subtly bizarre tale. A Hunger Artist is another story of delightful absurdity. I’m glad I finally read more of his work. I can see the influence he’s had on other authors I’ve read since."
In the Penal Colony,4,"August 19, 2014","In the Penal Colony is a typical Kafkaesque (yes, that's a word) story. After all, Franz Kafka IS the author. The story is about an explorer who visits a tropical colony to get ideas from its justice system, which appears to be very flawed and brutal. The language may seem a bit weird as it is translated German, but the overall story and idea are very simple, yet grotesquely creative. Usually, after reading a story by Kafka, I have to ponder upon its meaning for a while since Kafka's stories are all very abstract. If you enjoy doing that, you would enjoy In the Penal Colony."
In the Penal Colony,5,"July 30, 2012","I have very few words to describe the feeling after having read my very first Franz Kafka writing. It was frightening and at the same time depressing. I wanted to get over with the ordeal as soon as possible as I reached the very crux of the story's happenings. The story and its narrative were very much unsympathetic and thats what makes Kafka what he is. Well, I dont have to panic for being any more verbose, to describe 'In a Penal Colony'. It is simply 'Kafkaesque'."
In the Penal Colony,2,"December 23, 2016","My first Kafkaesque experience, which I took on as a suggested prep for a book I'm about to mandatorily read as part of a project to read all 1,001 Books to Read Before You Die: The 120 Days of Sodom. I found the story grotesque, horrifying, evil in its banality, and disturbing in its punctilious detail. I now feel ready for more Kafka - shades of Poe, of whom I'm a fan - but will still address Sodom through the gaps between my trembling fingers."
In the Penal Colony,5,"May 28, 2013","Quite unsettling to start with and ultimately satisfying. Kafkaesque is a word and this story is possibly the definition of it. I kind of knew what I was getting myself in for at the start but didn't really appreciate how disturbing it was going to be. It really gives you a sense of the brutality of justice, the subjectivity of perspectives and the unintended consequences of some decisions."

The Man in the High Castle,4,"May 21, 2015","This book really impacts the reader. I am still under its effect, having just finished it. The word ""Kafkaesque"" would apply here. But in the midst of this dystopian society where the Nazis and the Japanese have divided the world, there are still people of integrity and there is still hope."
The Man in the High Castle,4,"July 19, 2017","Obviously, he is getting the recognition he should've received well over 40 or 50 years ago. The Man in the High Castle is one of his literary masterpieces. Sure, I'll always side with A Scanner Darkly, maybe Valis too, but this one is truly spectacular. A book of ideas, The Man in the High Castle combines politics, philosophy, science, art and a handful of colourful characters stuck in an alternate world, where they all somehow know something else is going on behind the veil of so-called reality. Part Orwellian, part Kafkaesque and part Dostoyevskian in its themes of political oppression under totalitarian regimes, existential alienation, and religious, philosophical and psychological investigation, The Man in the High Castle is a thrilling piece of fiction."
The Man in the High Castle,2,"December 12, 2016","Ok, so Philip K Dick is just too esoteric for me. Every book I've read has about 40% that I really like, that are clever, well-thought, and interesting. While the other parts are weird, sometimes they feel kafkaesque, or trippy, and I don't get them (or at least, their relevance and what they do in the book). As always I liked the premise (also, I'm a sucker for Nazis-have-won books), but the more it progressed the more I felt like I should take some drugs to properly understand the book. Not to say that it's a bad book, but it's just not for me."

Sputnik Sweetheart,3,"January 16, 2025","not my favourite murakami but definitely had aspects of his writing that i enjoyed; his transporting descriptions of places, his in depth studies on relationships and his kafkaesque style. as per, questioning female characters, however i think he made the male character equally flawed. cute and i liked the metaphors surrounding the sputniks."
Sputnik Sweetheart,4,"March 14, 2018","""As I talked to her and read her stories, my mind quietly expanded...."" So says K, our hapless narrator, speaking of Sumire, the quirky, mysterious woman he loves. The words seemed to fit how I usually feel reading Murakami, this book being no exception and, in fact, a good prototype or example--cats, Kafka, and music being well represented. (By Kafka, I guess it's more appropriate to say Kafkaesque, as these lines evoke, when K goes in search of the vanished Sumire and thinks, ""I felt as if I was in a dream. the principle that made other choices possible was missing."")"
Sputnik Sweetheart,5,"January 9, 2010","Like all Murakami novels, this one too has a very dream-like, almost fairy tale-ish quality to it. But it’s relatively less surreal and Kafkaesque than his earlier work and can be called a quick-read. The book is narrated by K, who is in love with his 22-year-old college mate Sumire. But Sumire is the misfit/oddball, wannabe Jack Kerouac who falls in love with Mui, a woman 17 years her senior. The story revolves around the unrequited love and loneliness of these three individuals who become each others’ Sputnik (Russian for travelling companion) “We were wonderful travelling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits.”"
Sputnik Sweetheart,4,"October 23, 2016","A traditional Murakami book can be divided into three categories by genre. The first half is a typical romance story to build character. While the main character is unnamed (another characteristic of his novels), the main focus of the story lays on the progression of the love interest. What better way to develop a sense of character than what that person is like through the eyes of someone who loves them. The second part becomes a mystery novel. Like in other Murakami novels (like A Wild Sheep Chase) something happens that forces our nameless hero to travel and solve a mystery. This is where the real meat of the story happens. Then at the climax the novel becomes somewhat of a science fiction novel, supernatural happenings occur that leave you wondering what really happen. With this final supernatural climax the novel comes to an end, leaving many questions. This is why many people would consider his works Kafkaesque, most things are not clearly explained. This is the typical format of his novels, A Wild Sheep Chase certainly follows this formula and After Dark strays from this a little but not too much."
Civilization and Its Discontents,Not rated,"March 21, 2020","Still the unavoidable awfulness for which we are all responsible, the lingering painful consequences of economic growth and development, our Kafkaesque guilt - it works for me, or doesn't maybe. I had the sense that if Freud had not existed, it would have been necessary to have invented him as a cultural and social critic, poking beneath the surface of our accepted realities, an example here. It is a version of Enlightenment thinking that has limited faith in the goodness of human nature in a Darwinist world - everything is subject to the powers of reasoned analysis and observation, but what people say and believe about themself must not be taken at face value - just look at the self-destructiveness we see in figures in public and private life. Finally Freud looks forward to the possibility that we will be able to analyse entire ages and historical societies ""one day somebody will venture upon such a pathological study of cultural communities"" (p.117)"
Petersburg,5,"February 6, 2016","Indeed it often seems as if the world of ‘Petersburg’ reflects the world of dreams-the reader feels like the two protagonists of the novel, Apollon and Nikolai Appollonovich, two characters who are somnambulating through life, trapped in their ghoulish fantasies-the senator Apollon trapped in the Kafkaesque world of Russian bureaucracy and Nikolai, trapped between the logic of Kant and the illogic of political terrorism, of his love for the wife his best friend, a love which manifests itself via mutual torture and recrimination, and in Nikolai dressing up as a domino to humiliate Sofya Petrovna. At times ghoulish and garish, Bely invents the garrulous world of Petersburg’s political underbelly, a world in which a network of terrorists are trying to coerce Nikolai to commit patricide, by blowing his father up via ticking bomb in a sardine tin."
Sophie s World,5,"July 11, 2021","This must have something to do with the spirited way Gaarder writes, as least in my opinion; the words really come to life, as do the tales about the (long dead 'stuffy' (but not at all)) philosopers and their thoughts. But also, and this is my third point, the story itself. Which is not just a story, but a story within a story within a story? What a wonderful mind Jostein Gaarder has; boundless in his imagination, exploratory almost, gently probing the reader to open up their mind, ending on an almost Kafkaesque note (which I personally recognize from his other works and hugely enjoy). It almost feels like Gaarder is slowly prying to open up the mind of the adult reading the novel, while probably seemlessly connecting to the minds of his younger readers (as I remember not remembering finding the storyline in any way strange as a kid)."
the yellow birds,5,"April 12, 2013","I think this is the best book I've read so far this year (It's only April, there's time to find a good competitor). It's beautifully written, the story is captivating, it's poetic and deep and leaves a hard impact. I haven't read any other books about the Iraq war but this one definitely competes with some of the best anti-war books from the WWII and Vietnam eras (I'm looking at you Slaughterhouse 5 and Catch 22). It's actually really interesting to compare this with those postmodern classics. It carries many of the same themes — losing your grasp on identity, on righteousness, on sanity, on time and causality — but it does away with the pleasantries of humor. Where WWII produced postmodern satire, Iraq seems to have produced some postmodern version of Greek tragedy. The whole book is beautifully hopeless, an endless descent into existential despair — it's Kafkaesque, really. This is a beautiful work that I think they'll be teaching in classrooms 40 years from now."
Great Expectations,4,"December 23, 2022","Joskus tuli mietittyä ketkä kirjailijat ovat saaneet adjektiivin englannin kieleen omasta nimestään. Kafkaesque, Dickensian, Orwellian ja Pinteresque tuli ainakin mieleen. Toki on käytetty monia muitakin, mutta nuo löytynevät hyvästä sanakirjastakin. En tiedä onko tuo varsinaisesti mikään kunnianosoitus, mutta kertoohan se siitä, että on onnistunut kirjoissaan luomaan maailman, joka on niin omintakeinen, että sille on keksittävä sana. Dickensian-sanalla tarkoitetaan köyhien olojen kuvaamista, sosiaalista epäoikeudenmukaisuutta ja koomisen luotaantyötäviä hahmoja eli sitä mitä nyt kuvittelemme Viktorian ajan Lontoon olleen. Kaikkea tuota löytyy, mutta hillitysti myös tästä myöhäistuotannon klassikosta."
Great Expectations,4,"February 23, 2025","She is the heart of this novel’s kafkaesque horror—an eerie, decaying figure, frozen in time, wrapped in yellowed lace and regret. A woman so consumed by betrayal that she forces the world to suffer alongside her. Her mansion is a mausoleum, her clocks all stopped, her wedding feast left to rot on the table. Everything about her is a fever dream, a ghost story made flesh, and yet? You love her. She is terrifying, tragic, and unforgettable."
blindness,4,"August 27, 2007","this is the first of a two-part inquiry by jose saramago into the implications of the phenomenon of cultural blindness. because it is jose saramago, and he is a literalist, he makes this come alive by introducing us to a city hit by a sudden and devastating blindness epidemic. no one knows why the first man (in a sense, very much like albert camus' first man in his ambiguous and rather anonymous depiction in the novel) went blind, or why it becomes infectious. understandably, complete chaos ensues, but we realize that one woman, the wife of the opthalmologist first exposed to the blind seeking help, is inexplicably immune. i have come to think that she represents the spiritual guide that helps us through the novel, and somehow manages to remain a bastion of calm and reason even in the face of horrific circumstances. in other words, she is a grace, a muse embodying hope. the main characters, a core of five or six of the first individuals to go blind, must find their way through the labyrinthine and kafkaesque setting of the mental institution designated by the government for quarantine. the blind are herded there, left with little sustenance and no guarantee of supervision and very quickly people become survivalist, some altruistically, and some in a savage, aggressive and violent manner. the haphazard organization that emerges is threatened by a band of rogue blind men who demand food and supplies from the various barracks and rape the women. as in 1984, there is an announcement played over a loudspeaker at the same time every day, repeating instructions and essentially threatening death if anyone plans to escape. deftly and surreptitiously, the opthalmologist's wife helps as many people as she can. left to their own devices, the inmates soon understand that the entire city has been overtaken. in many ways, this book is a tender character study revealing the rapidity with which human frailty wreaks havoc on moral codes and ethical systems. i read the second part of the series, ""seeing"", but i would NOT recommend this, as saramago's extremely fluid style, sometimes annoyingly lacking in punctuation, does not serve the less philosophical project of exploring the political resistance of the people involved in the epidemic years later. this book was ultimately readable, frightening, and fits under the aegis of the apocalyptic/disaster literature that some of the greatest living writers have been causing to flourish."
blindness,3,"January 8, 2015","So Kafkaesque, and this is actually not a plus. I already had a taste of Saramago with All the Names but I hoped to see a change in stile, while, actually this one is even more Kafkaesque. The author definitely has something against authority - I actually agree with him on this plan. Leave it to the state to degrade you in the name of the grater good. Leave it to the state to promise and not deliver and to remind you daily, shamelessly, how the authority will take care of you, will provide food 3 times a day; that you have responsibilities toward the state and the others and you should act accordingly, being understood that even death is acceptable for the greater good(no drugs, if fire starts no one will intervene to save them). Leave it to the army(the extended hand of the state) to kill you if you dare to revolt, but it will be on a self defense base, obviously."
blindness,4,"June 10, 2007","A Kafkaesque parable, deeply unsettling, and a probing analysis of human nature. I found it disturbing and amazing (and I also kept thinking I was going blind, for whatever reason)."
blindness,5,"June 30, 2024","The premise of the novel, that is the sudden outbreak of an implausible white blindness, is undoubtedly kafkaesque in nature. Many of his other works such as “Seeing”, “Death with Interruptions” and “The Gospel According to Jesus” also have an unexplained impossible premise that the characters have to deal with throughout the novel. There is however a contrast to tradition kafkaesque themes where the story usually ends with doom as Saramago highlights the necessity of love, goodness and happiness in life."
blindness,4,"April 9, 2023",The masterstroke of a Kafkaesque world is the ease with which characters accept their bizarre fate. They key is to make the readers react and not the characters. “Blindness” by Jose Saramago (translated by Giovanni Pontiero) does exactly that.
blindness,3,"February 18, 2025","There's also some really tough materials. Not to go into details but there's graphic rape scenes, violence and overall disgust. It's not for the faint hearted. But it was still a really interesting exploration of the human psyche - kafkaesque at times and the author has a really interesting style where you can really feel the emotion of the characters and their situation."
blindness,4,"April 13, 2023","Interesting book with a Kafkaesque premise that doesn't entirely pay off, but nonetheless keeps the book flowing. I would recommend it."
blindness,5,"June 2, 2023","An underrated joy. The Kafkaesque concept plays faithfully throughout, leading us to the only conclusion it could have taken us toward."
blindness,4,"October 6, 2019","A quirky Kafkaesque dystopian novel I'm not sure I understood but I enjoyed (not sure that's the right word) all the same. I particularly like how Saramago doesn't shirk the nitty gritty details of the practical implications of mass blindness and societal breakdown, lack of food, power, sanitation and water supply. Truly horrific! I must say this is not a book for sensitive readers, covering sexual exploitation in a very matter of fact way."
blindness,3,"March 6, 2009","I am not sure I can review this book - it struck me as somewhat Kafkaesque. Beautiful writing but so disturbing that I had to carefully limit my reading time and conditions(e.g., do not read while eating).One man suddenly goes blind - blind but with a constant white blinding light. The condition spreads. With panic mounting the government interns the first 300 blind people in an ancient insane asylum. The wife of one blinded man accompanies him and for some reason she never goes blind. The blind live in horrible conditions and things become worse and worse. There is a good bit of inhumanity towards each other and no food and no water. A small loose community grows."
blindness,3,"June 5, 2010","The ending disappointed me -- felt hasty and Hollywoodish. But had it ended the way I expected -- with the doctor's wife also losing her sight on a trip back from the storeroom and not being able to find the others -- would have been too Kafkaesque, I suppose."
blindness,2,"February 8, 2017","The plot however was nothing I haven't heard of before. Saramago asks the same questions about humanity in the face of a global catastrophe as The Walking Dead Comics or other apocalyptic literature does. There is no deeper insight or anything other than nihilism and some kafkaesque ideas. It is still very suspenseful, anyway."
blindness,4,"March 19, 2011","I read this but the database did not have the German edition. It is very Kafkaesque, depressing but a very interesting story and development"
After Dark,5,"April 6, 2022","Takahashi also mentions the hugely detrimental impact that attending court cases has on him - he begins to feel just as the criminals in the cases do, as they are all mere humans under the influence of some giant, undefeatable, octopus-like monster which probably represents bureaucracy. This reminds me of Kafka's 'The Trial' - in fact, at times this book is very Kafkaesque. The most important thing about this omnipresent monster in relation to the story in 'After Dark' is the fact that it renders all humans identical - which means that all minds are identical, so in the same way that the mind of the criminal being tried at court enters Takahashi's, perhaps the minds of humans can penetrate each other far easier than we think. This may explain the room that Eri enters, which seems to be in a different dimension - it's almost as if she's slept so soundly that she's entered the mind of another human being."
After Dark,4,"October 12, 2010","It is a slow but poignant novel, which resembles Kafka more closely than any other I’ve read. However, unlike the Kafkaesque dystopic psychological themes, Murakami’s After Dark has strong latent aspects of hope, not the naive hope and vulgar sentimentalism that suffocates the work of Paulo Coelho, but the buried hope that tries constantly to reach out from a world that invites nihilism and despair."
After Dark,5,"January 18, 2025","It was so captivating, I couldn't get my eyes off from Murakami's writing. I miss the conversation and the strange night like he portraited here. Such loneliness, deepness, vulnerability he echoed went through my heart. As always the absurdity, the kafkaesque of his works was only his alone. What a story!"
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,5,"July 28, 2013","Sorry, this play's too good. It may be built with Hamlet, but the structure's hardly fragile. Even on the page, the essence of character and image is immutably translated. There is a kind of brilliance at work here, as the play transforms from a literary and linguistic trick to something more visually involving and disorienting. And yet, it's also such a fluid and fun experience. Stoppard takes the labyrinthine madness of Kafka and puts it in Shakespeare. Or perhaps he elicits the Kafkaesque qualities that lay dormant in Shakespeare for centuries. One thing I can say is that Stoppard's play has sustained purpose in this world of which I can't say about the titular characters in their own. Ah, yes."
Dubliners,4,"July 22, 2021","The first was the story Counterparts, about a man (Farrington) who we stumble upon having a bad day at work, and the night only gets worse. The first third of this story evoked such a feeling of entrapment in me, that I could hardly continue reading. An initial reading of this story wouldn't evoke strong feelings of sympathy for our hero who beats his children and drinks away all of his money. It is all his fault that his life is this way, right? And yet something in the prose brought out a visceral feeling of losing one's way. His job is Kafkaesque in it's monotony, he hates everyone he works with, literally nothing in his life is going the way he would have liked. And then his once chance to exert control and dominance over his life is used on beating his children."
The Sons,3,"January 31, 2024","Ok so...there's no denying that Kakfa is a great writer. He really takes you along the thought processes of his characters in a sort of fussy irony that's both comedic (like, relatable and almost cartoonishly dramatic) and also that classic ""kafkaesque"" nausea from things just going around in circles or social structures being shallowly founded but toilfully withheld or castrated under. The first story, The Judgement, was absurd in a funny way, but also tragic which I suppose is pretty classic of his tone as well. I tend to like stories that are on the shorter side since they tend to pull the punches succinctly and this story is a good example of that albeit kind of just like a long joke. The second story, The Stoker, kinda moseyed around a bit in a way that kind of felt almost aggravating and aimless, but I think that was the whole point of it because it matches how the character is just kind of flung into this situation and looking for someone/something to latch onto for himself. And it was supposed to be a chapter of a book, not an entire piece so it was likely building up towards something. The last story, The Metamorphosis, I really liked. The way Kafka described the situation and the character's choices of behavior illustrated this deep burden of history for Gregor amongst his family and work, and that becoming an insect was like a cruel wish fulfillment or even self realization for him to finally be left alone and perish under his circumstances. I could relate in the sense of feeling really useless and scrutinized by my father and then becoming idle from the weight, as I think most of us can."
The Sons,5,"September 21, 2021",Did you know that Franz Kafka has an adjective on his name called 'Kafkaesque'? It signifies oppressive or nightmarish qualities of Kafka's work or of the object for which the adjective is used.
The Sons,4,"December 23, 2017","It is now for me that the word 'Kafkaesque' is, in its true essence, not like I had aspired to pay as much research or aspiration to it earlier, been justified. I have finally been acquainted with Franz Kafka and known the 'oppressive' and 'nightmarish' quality of his fictional world; I am still trying to figure out how it could both be terrifyingly and pleasantly gripping. Perhaps terrifying would be justifiable still for any scholar, of any level, even of a reader's, of Kafka, but the idea of pleasure that comes for me is the resonance of classic literature that Kafka's works bear-yet unique than any and every Wilde, Dickens and Austen. The patient construction of scenes, emotions, perplexities, conflicts, moods, forms, descriptions, with the delectable marriage of words and fascinating ideas and thoughts, I totally fell for. He controls you, this writer, against your own will, and rather coerces to bring you to his Kafkaesque world where you sip tea and get haunted."
The Sons,3,"August 21, 2023","The content of these stories is simply incredible, along with the emotions that drive them, and the way Kafka is able to describe how the characters feel about certain things is so perfect I can’t begin to explain. Though, I was expecting to come away with finally knowing what “Kafkaesque” means, these three stories (and one long letter) are all so different from each other that I think the meaning may be even more shrouded in mystery than before. Something dark and to do with fathers? Who knows! The only caveat I have with it is that these texts are just so old reading them feels like wading through molasses. Everything takes so long and every page is just so dense. Really more of a personal preference thing, but it’s definitely why it took me three weeks to read 167 pages. Anyway. Kafka is Kool!"
The Sons,5,"July 21, 2018",When in Prague......bought from the Globe English book shop (lovely cafe too) my first foray into the Kafkaesque nightmare so to speak. I was expecting his work to be a more difficult read but no - the style was very modern and enjoyable. The short stories are a must and now to dive into a novel. This collection is how he originally wanted these three short stories published - together. He said they went together in and obvious and secret way! The obvious - father issues. The secret - he didn’t really become a giant bug!
tender is the flesh,5,"October 26, 2024","One star just for taking me off guard with that ending. But now at the end, it feels more truer to its essence. Only with time and continuous indifference towards brutality/injustice you end up becoming that you hated the most. It reminds me of 1984, nothing similar whatsoever, just the both leaves you with same aftertaste of utter hopelessness and sadness. A crippling, encompassing hopelessness which you can't escape. Your hope placed on one person, the protagonist, dies a horrible death sealing the fate of this Kafkaesque world with irreversible finality."
tender is the flesh,5,"September 20, 2021","The early part of the book is a horrifying but wonderfully resonant metaphor about the mechanisms by which people avoid the evils of factory farming by assigning banal names to things (""head""), not giving names to those slaughtered, using numbers and designations and bureaucracy and rules to avoid ""unnecessary pain""... and so on. The story is told through the eyes of one man, a well respected higher up at a slaughterhouse who is realizing how horrifying and disgusting cannibalism is. There's also an important side focus on the absence of animals. Most animals have been killed and cremated to avoid the virus, so Marcos, the man with misgivings, often reflects on his past enjoyment of their&nbsp;pets and the zoo with his father, who loved birds and animals. I thought this was a really powerful part of the novel, this part of humanity losing the&nbsp;pleasures of humanness. Its translated, but the prose is sparse, but the story moves well, a little Kafkaesque, not great character development, but some. So overall, it was challenging and engaging, and one of those books you keep thinking ahead to the next 15 minutes you've got to read it. (I almost wrote consume it...)"
tender is the flesh,1,"March 19, 2023","It could have worked as kafkaesque surreal nightmare but author decided to make ""serious"" dystopia out of it—with world building by explanations and reasoning which simply doesn't make any sense."
Saffron and Brimstone,4,"June 29, 2014","The first story was creepy, a little Kafkaesque in my mind, which is great because I love Kafka. Be assured these are strange and beautiful stories, and not everyone loves fantasist stories- since I do, I can say I enjoyed Hand's magical spinning. I really have to read her novels."

Swann s Way,3,"March 6, 2024","I've never read Proust but having heard the name referenced enough, I thought it time to give one of his books a try. After all, I read Kafka, I am now qualified to call something 'Kafkaesque'; although the right moment for that has yet to arise. Perhaps now, I can use the phrase 'Proustian moment'! 'Swann's Way' is part of a larger collection labeled 'In Search of Lost Time' or 'Remembrance of Things Past.' Both themes are prominent as Proust explores the ways in which we remember as well as the ways we are remembered."
Swann s Way,Not rated,"September 17, 2020","It's like a saying I read somewhere - Proust is for life - which I think I'm able to understand now. The term ""Proustian"" had such an enigmatic character to itself for me, much like the word ""Kafkaesque"" would be for people who haven't read Kafka, that the more and more I encountered it, more and more I became intrigued and perhaps a bit afraid as well of getting disillusioned when I finally do make its acquaintance. There were a lot of moments in the book where I questioned why exactly was I reading it, followed by an intense love for the sheer pages in front of me, and sometimes ending with an indifference to an entire chapter. This ebb and flow of emotions continued throughout the book, and I'm afraid in the end, it still remains an enigma for me."
Never Let Me Go,4,"February 21, 2021","He is unapologetic about repetition, citing the “continuity” of great film directors (he is a huge cinephile), and likes to claim that each of his first three books was essentially a rewrite of its predecessor. “Literary novelists are slightly defensive about being repetitive,” he says. “I think it is perfectly justified: you keep doing it until it comes closer and closer to what you want to say each time.” He gets away with it, he says, by changing location or genre: “People are so literal they think I’m moving on.” For him, genre is like travel, and it is true that he has enjoyed genre-hopping: When We Were Orphans (detective fiction); Remains of the Day (period drama); The Unconsoled (Kafkaesque fable); Never Let Me Go (dystopian sci-fi) and The Buried Giant (Tolkienish fantasy). Now, as the title Klara and the Sun hints, he visits what he calls “children’s storyland”. But be warned, we are still very much in Ishiguroland."
Never Let Me Go,5,"September 20, 2021","It is a moral tale about science and the soul, set in a private school in the English countryside, where the children are told repeatedly that they are special. But they are not told why. They are not told much of anything that matters, and therein lies the beautiful, slow reveal for the reader. I’m tempted to compare the novel to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, but without the Monster. The setting and the story are immediately Kafkaesque, with teachers who are called Guardians and frequent references to a vague future that includes donors and carers."
Never Let Me Go,4,"April 13, 2023","It's strange how there is this rushing tide of nihilism that sweeps you off your feet as the book draws to a close. It feels incredibly sad and hopeless; I suppose, in that sense it's rather Kafkaesque."
Never Let Me Go,4,"July 22, 2024",As Kathy progresses through her story with her relationships with friends and lover it becomes very clear there is something dark and sinister at play. The language used seems euphemistic when you begin to understand true meanings around a ‘carer’ and ‘completing’. The world becomes Kafkaesque as we see they are part of an institutional system where they lack any free will or autonomy.
Never Let Me Go,4,"January 11, 2023","Overall, I highly recommend Never Let Me Go to readers who are looking for a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful story with Austenian and Kafkaesque elements. It's a unique and powerful exploration of humanity and what it means to be human. 4-star reading experience for me."
Never Let Me Go,3,"March 29, 2021","What a strange book. It’s Kafkaesque in that the characters are caught within a brutal societal machinery, but they don’t seem to mind. No one complains or rails against their fate. No one wants to change the dystopia, they simply want to understand it and try to enjoy their place in it. Compelling, but it left me feeling strange about the unanswered moral quagmire. Even the few people who try to help end up shrugging and walking away. The endurance of memory in the face of the inevitable seems to be all that matters. Unsettling."
Never Let Me Go,4,"April 10, 2025","Ishiguro's world is most absurd and hopeless. A Kafkaesque dystopia in which the most ironically human characters grip the reader tightly and keeps them wading through an ankle-deep tide of love, hope, and dependence, one within which the reader hopes to turn from in triumph with raised hands. The title is the essence of the profundity and rebellion of this novel that constitutes its charm - Never Let Me Go - against the void of what the world has to give, Never Let Me Go."
Never Let Me Go,5,"June 20, 2012",An emotionally powerful novel that manages to be both kafkaesque and a compelling coming of age story.
a little life,3,"August 3, 2015","I was more excited to read this book than I have any other book for a long time, but I do think that it was quite winded most of the time. Excellent character development but I wasn't satisfied with the developments as a whole, which I think I could have been with how long the book is. Also, the ridiculous amount of torturous tragedy and suffering in this book was borderline Kafkaesque. The main problem I had with this book was that it seemed like Jude's inner thoughts/feelings were rehashed and restated way too much. I would have liked to see more deeply into the other characters but Jude was fascinating nonetheless. I don't regret reading it but it is a shame that I really feel no desire to read a $30 book again."
dark matter,4,"June 24, 2024","Then, chapter 13 happened. He goes into the mail/chat thing. Why? Didn't really make sense, but in Crouch style, ... blast past the why/how and just get to the what if. Suddenly, Jason is chatting with several other Jasons. I loved this Kafkaesque moment. Then,  he encounters a bunch of other Jason's. It was like the scene in the Matrix where Neo fights off a horde of Agent Smith clones. And, ... I decided Jason was a good name for the character, because it became a little spooky/sinister there and for me, channeled a bit of Jason from Friday the 13th. It was a little crazy, but I still liked it. It also seemed impossible to recover from that. I like that it really tipped into no light at the end of the tunnel territory. But, he did return to the light after all, and it wasn't entirely deus ex machina. It seemed reasonable. So, ... nice twist, ... nice recovery, ... and overall: well done."
dark matter,4,"August 9, 2022",A more Kafkaesque and darker first draft of his later work Recursion.
my first kafka,3,"May 13, 2015","Depressing tales aside, the illustrations accompanying them are surreal and oddly beautiful. The swirls of black and white convey mood, atmosphere and expression with robustness just as powerful as color and aptly suited to Kafkaesque themes. So this book gets my qualified approval. I’m just not certain it’s suitable for the kiddies."
Steppenwolf,3,"April 11, 2025","While the writing was never my absolute favorite at any point., there was a significant drop-off point towards the final third where the storytelling shifts from being just a slightly absurd retelling from a diary to plain nightmarish surrealism that didn’t really impress me all too much. The surreal parts here are almost too literal in their non-literal exploration of the inner mind that it kind of became a little too on-the-nose for me. I didn’t really enjoy the climactic journey through abstract self-reflection and reconstruction, it felt like a literary ayahuasca trip, and what began as an almost Dostoyevskian character study of inner turmoil and misery instead became a dream-like montage in Kafkaesque territory of very oblique, yet bluntly insistent images, almost reminding me a bit of The Trial). I get why some people consider Hesse to be a writer for adolescents; I would have loved this in my mid-teenage years, at fifteen I may have appreciated this a lot more, but what is displayed in this novel is something that offers a surface level of psychological complexity, not necessarily something inexhaustible or dense. The whole modernist part of it all that subverts traditional narrative (though the entire text inherently doesn’t follow a traditional structure) is more or less a dumbed-down version of what other writers of his time did with the novel. It’s like how Christopher Nolan’s films are supposed to be these mind-bending and subversive works of art according to his fans, whereas, to most other people who have seen more than your random average film-bro, realize that what he’s doing isn’t bad, but barely anything special, challenging or uniquely potent. I really liked this novel at first and many passages are memorable and very well written, but overall, I hope his other novels will impress me more, because I do plan on reading more of him at some point in the future. It was creative, but I wish it managed to be a little more interesting and had more to say."
Steppenwolf,5,"November 1, 2022","Holy shit this was brilliant. Fascinatingly dark and clever, kafkaesque, twisted and scathing and terribly perceptive. It’s a masterful mushroom trip of a book, hurtling us deep into the depraved and rejected aspects of the human, teaching us, ultimately, that all parts are equally welcome, and primal joy is the medicine for everything."
Steppenwolf,5,"March 30, 2024","This is the most profoundly philosophical novel I have ever read! Up with the classics like Plague, Sisyphus, Nausea, and Kafkaesque world literature. If you have to read one book by Hermann Hesse then I would gladly slide over Siddhartha and choose this one any day with no regrets!"
Steppenwolf,4,"July 16, 2025","after years i finally managed to finish steppenwolf in my conquest of german literature. interesting read. i like the goethe references because i read faust shortly before. i like my existential literature more kafkaesque, so sometimes it was a hard read, but worth it in the end. on to Glasperlenspiel next"
life after life,5,"June 5, 2013","Exceptional novel this one, a highly imaginative match of historical fiction and kafkaesque surrealism. Extended review available on MINA'S BOOKSHELF http://minadecaro.blogspot.com/2013/0..."
life after life,4,"January 24, 2014","I've read all of Kate Atkinson's books, and loved every one. This one I liked a lot, enough to give it 4 stars, but it didn't have her very clever humour in evidence, quite so much as her other books do. But then, the subject matter is a bit more serious. War. It was an intriguing read, stories within stories, which overlap, intersected, ran in parallel, like some sort of Kafkaesque set theory. I did feel there were some unresolved ""issues"", but then perhaps that was the idea. Leave you guessing. I did enjoy it though. Thanks Mr D!"
life after life,5,"January 26, 2014","Brilliant structure. A cross between Benjamin Button, Ground Hog Day, and a Kafkaesque mentality. Main character is born in 1911.... narrates events from a number of viewpoints up through the 1990's."
Heart of a Dog,4,"February 4, 2016","What happens when a Russian stray dog meets a early Soviet doctor? Testicles and pituitary glands get involved and a New Soviet man is made. Part Kafkaesque transformation story, part mockery of eugenics and early Soviet attempts at creating the ideal Russian man, Bulgakov's novella is not quite as brilliant as The Master and Margarita, but still it is a stunning example of underground Soviet literature. It is funny, absurd, dark, and worth an afternoon."
Heart of a Dog,4,"September 1, 2023","Funny, clever, and satirical, this Kafkaesque tale will surely delight current readers and probably shocked those who read it upon publication. The slapstick humor doesn't survive translation and time intact but those familiar with Soviet Era Russia will be rolling with laughter, gasping with awe at the brazen criticism and may even find surreal parallels in many countries on the other side of the iron curtain."
Heart of a Dog,4,"August 24, 2020","I had a lot of fun with this brief novelette. Bizarre and absurd, though less Kafkaesque paranoia and neuroses, and more Gogol's ridiculous 'The Nose', the story makes you chuckle and grimace (some of the plotting is gross) in equal measure. I maybe even enjoyed this more than his MASTERpiece, but it fails to echo post-reading in quite the same way."
Heart of a Dog,3,"March 21, 2025",Still an interesting premise but going towards Kafkaesque and with hints of Frankenstein.
Heart of a Dog,4,"February 13, 2023","It's Kafkaesque, funny, full of surprising moments and inscrutable scenarios, yet it always manages to be firmly readable and the strangeness seems intentional enough that it didn't turn me away."
Heart of a Dog,5,"November 5, 2016",A brilliant Science Fiction Satire that also functions at the level of Literary Fiction and social commentary...with a special interest in classism and Kafkaesque bureaucracy.
Heart of a Dog,5,"September 15, 2017","Bu hikâye, sokak köpeği Şarik'in yaşamak zorunda kaldığı olaylar ve Profesör Filipoviç çevresinde evriliyor. Takdir edeceğiniz üzere Bolşevik Devrimi sonrasında köklü değişiklikler yaşanıyor Rusya'da ve bu değişiklikler siyasî ve bürokratik parametrelerle sınırlı değil sadece. Yaratılmak istenen ideal proleter modeli, burjuva hayâllerinin sıradanlığı ve bayağılığı, Sovyetlerin arzuladıkları değişimleri yaratmaya çalışırken uyguladığı politikalar ve onların trajikomik sonuçları, Bulgakov'un usta dili ve özenle yarattığı Kafkaesque atmosfer ile karşınızda."
The Book of Evidence,4,"February 8, 2012","very satisfying read...i can see why he is a worthy nobel...kafkaesque...the more i read banville, more I seem to find traces of his prose in other writers.....why, i thought there were hints of atwood in this book....all in all, a short book...can b finished in 2 nights"
The Jungle,4,"August 2, 2013","This is well worth reading. It's known for its exposure of the horrors of industrial food and as a great early exemplar of a muckracking expose. It's great to engage with that context in mind. But it's also a good story of a man and many others trying to navigate his and their the impossibly Kafkaesque --no, much, much worse-- stations as the unskilled and the immigrant in turn of 20th-century Chicago. Welcome to the land of the free, you ""tired, poor ... huddled masses yearning to breathe free ... wretched refuse ... homeless"", etc., people."
A Confederacy of Dunces,4,"January 9, 2022","Still, A Confederacy of Dunces is a book you have to take at face value, like it or leave it. I had so much fun in the company of Ignatius and co. The ending is brilliant, a breathless Kafkaesque nightmare. The mother's betrayal turns the book into a prequel from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest but Ignatius' refusal to accept his fate and the timely appearance of the semi-mythical Minkoff, conjures a surprise ending that is the great American escape - escape from America and everything it demands Ignatius be. We know that Ignatius can't hide forever and we also don't want him to. The pity we feel is tempered by disgust at the crude and selfish parts of his character. This slothenly, puritanical monster has been created and informed by a society that doesn't find space for those who don't comply. Despite the laughs and the nonsense, A Confederacy of Dunces is a genuinely sad novel about modern dislocation and not belonging anywhere."
harry potter and the order of the phoenix,4,"October 16, 2017","This was my favorite Harry Potter book up until the end. (Is it just me, or does J.K. Rowling pretty much blow the conclusion to every Harry Potter book, except the Half-Blood Prince?) Dolores Umbridge was my favorite villain in the series for her cruel, Kafkaesque ways. The final action (which I won't spoil) though, just falls apart. No deus ex machina like the Philosopher's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets, and the Goblet of Fire, but still a let-down for the perfect buildup."
Underground,3,"March 16, 2016","My sister asked me if I can get a copy of this book, and since it was interesting, and it's not a Murakami novel, I thought, let me give it a try. You see, my problem is simply, I think he writes in a Kafkaesque atmosphere, and although Kafka really write piercingly into your soul, or at least dark enough that makes you search in the corner of your heart whether you got it as well or not, I always ended up slightly depressed. Aaand I wasn't looking for something like that. At least not now. I like character study novels, you know like JA, Henry James, or epic story of people's struggle like Steinbeck's work. But at least, this is a compilation of interviews! So that's pretty okay. But even then, the outlook at the end of this book is still pretty dark. Hahaha."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"August 15, 2021","Murakami has everything I've been looking for in literature. If someone wants to read a Kafkaesque novel, direct them to this one. It was beautiful. I know that's a word we are taught to never use as writers, but that's the word I want to use. ""Beautiful"" manifests through your eyes, your perspective. Murakami has a way of creating a lens by which you can look through his stories and see into your own soul, and interpret a world you knew existed, but maybe denied. You always wanted it to exist. You know it's inside of you, all around you, even if you can't connect with it in your senses."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"May 25, 2015","This is a masterpiece. When reading Murakami my will to live is obliterated and my will to exist to my fullest potential begins. How beautiful are the simple details of life. But, Murakami ignores the simplest details. He wants you to look beyond the simple and the ordinary, without meaning to, he wants us to look at the profound joke that life is. He goes beyond reality in its truest sense. Surrealism is a joke, an undertone for him, he believes in full transcendental of the realm. Kafkaesque is an undertone. Dostoevskian is an undertone for Murakami. He is a religion to believe inthe beyond of life, he can make you think and believe that there is more to the unwashed, worm filled kitchen sink. He can make you believe that going down a deep, dry well to think is a good idea. He can make believe that you can look through an opaque wooden door, with your eyes closed. Reading Wind-up bird, Murakami seems as if a prophet of times to come, where supernatural is natural and unnatural at once in his journey."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"September 7, 2019","The writing is on the wall. Kumiko wants Toru to spend more time looking for the cat and he looks at his wife and remarks, “Hunched down in the dark with her gray shirt on, she looked like a piece of luggage that had been lost in the wrong place,” a line suffused with deep melancholy, but also characteristic of Murakami’s uncanny descriptive sensibilities. This may be a feature of the well known fact that Murakami writes first in English and then translates himself into Japanese, creating a new form of Japanese that relies on the English. Some much of Murakami’s power comes from this uncanniness. This feeling at once of familiarity and strangeness. In the way that the work of David Lynch has produced the word Lynchian to describe how the uncanny and abject invade domestic spaces, and most obviously how the oppressive and nightmarish qualities of the works of Franz Kafka can be transmitted with the adjective Kafkaesque, one wonders if Murakamian might be a useful term to describe how the surreal and the absurdly normal combine. This begs the question if any novelist with sufficient linguistic and atmospheric verve can be a candidate for adjectivization. Murakami also doesn’t follow a preordained outline before the beginning of a novel and follows his own impulses to draw out a narrative, and has said, ""The only way I knew was good music - rhythm, improvisation, harmony. I just know how to begin. If I knew how to finish, it wouldn't be fun because I'd know what would happen next. Writing is like dreaming when you're awake. When you're sleeping, you cannot dream a continuous dream. But when you're a writer, you can continue your dream every day. So it's fun."""
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"November 30, 2022","A book that is a Kafkaesque fever-dream within a fever-dream, leaving you questioning the authenticity and existence of both characters and events. Passages questioning the veil of reality are juxtaposed with sobering accounts of war atrocities during the reign of the Soviet Union, where Murakami takes a daring step into questioning Japan’s hand in the crimes committed against China and its citizens during this time."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"August 5, 2016","Murakami has a way with words that almost brags about his ability to mould, according to his will, to give form and structure to what others would just arbitrarily group together under one heading - ""the abstract"" - thoughts, emotions, the inexorable linkage of fate intertwined with people's lives, the deeply philosophical notions of the impermanence of the self of the characters portrayed, by blending together multiple realities from different eras into one smoothly coherent logical complex. At no point does the novel deliberately engage in ambiguous writing, indeed, the author makes it a point to be as crystal clear in the narrative as possible, however the concepts that the words point towards forever remain just beyond the grasp of perfect cognition by the reader, much like the Kafkaesque angst the protagonist experiences throughout the novel, constantly reflected in his moods, in his relations and his surroundings, in his efforts to come to terms with his own identity. The novel feels like one giant psychedelic picture that could be drawn, surreal enough should anyone take the effort with several re-readings to bring into complete focus, if indeed such an understanding is intended by the author to be grasped by the readers."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"April 22, 2008","Before S. Coppola's Lost in Translation there was Murakami's novel, a Kafkaesque exploration of finding one's way (personally and collectively) in a fragmented and possibly unknowable world. This is a mysterious, devious, and haunting novel, with all manner of eccentricities and oddities piled up inside of it; it's also a seductive and delightful page-turner, and thus nearly guarantees a memorable reading experience."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"October 4, 2018","This book reminds me of others, in “Kafka on the Shore” the protagonist is also hunting for a missing cat, which leads him to a whole series of adventures. One of the most memorable parts of the book is with the protagonist at the bottom of a well, which feels very Kafkaesque as he is gripped by an inertia and can’t do anything to save himself. In Pamuk’s “My Name is Red” the action begins at the bottom of a well with a murder victim recounting his story."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"October 11, 2022","If you like surreal; if you like David Lynch movies; if you like Kafkaesque craziness, then you may like this. I’ve read a couple of his fiction books before: Norwegian Wood and 1Q84, and I remember the second one in particular being very strange indeed."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,Not rated,"July 23, 2023","Magic realism? Kafkaesque? Dadaism? The convoluted plot opens with a few ""realistic"" events: a 30-ish man boy, Toru Okada, quits his dead end job, his cat runs away and then his wife disappears. Then everything turns: Toru consults psychics (one a prostitute of the body, now turned to the mind) which allow him to enter a shadowy surreal world: he goes through a wall in the bottom of a well, a blue mark - roughly hand-shaped - appears on his cheek, he is beaten up for no discernable reason, ""hired"" as a psychic healer and so much more."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,3,"May 4, 2020","A Kafkaesque nightmare unfolds, as Murakami takes a broad swing at connecting the moral, spiritual, and political consequences of Japan’s brutal World War II history to characters living in the post-Imperial era. To be sure, there are powerful scenes of comedy, menace, and intrigue . . . but the fragments never galvanize (at least not for me). Murakami seems to be making a statement: that we live in an incomprehensible, crazy world where nothing makes sense . . . yet, the statement lasts 660+ pages and makes for a disjointed, albeit beautifully strange, reading experience."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"March 14, 2017","But then there is the other kind of novel. These novels are Kafkaesque mysteries that never get resolved and usually have the narrator searching for something that he is destined to never find. The first four of these novels, Murakami's ""Rat Trilogy"" and then Dance, Dance, Dance have the same narrator. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle feels like it should be the fifth novel in that series but the narrator isn't the same person and there are no references to the events of the other novels. Still, this is like another version of those novels. The previously mentioned four novels have always been the Murakami novels that I have liked the least, but after reading Wind-Up Bird Chronicles I get it. This was what he was trying to do the whole time. That is why while he still writes novels in the other categories after this one he was completely done with that category of novel. There was no reason to go on after that, because this is the book that he had in mind when he became a writer and after five tries he finally nailed it."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"July 11, 2019","""Wind-Up Bird'' is part detective story, part bildungsroman, part fairy tale, part science-fiction-meets-Lewis Carroll's. Like ""A Wild Sheep Chase'' and ""Dance Dance Dance,'' it features a very ordinary man as its hero, a passive, affectless sort of guy with a lowly job and even lower expectations. Like those earlier novels, it sends its hero off on a long, strange wild goose chase that turns into a sort of Kafkaesque nightmare."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"December 1, 2021","I wanted to review this book just after I finished it, but I could not. The Wind Up Bird Chronicle is just too much, and I mean that in the best way. Reading a Murakami novel is like stepping into a lucid dream. The setting, characters, and events are realistic yet eerily off center. Anything can happen. Murakami doesn't write magical realism; rather, he's the very definition of Kafkaesque. Which is why I love his books so much. They transport me into another dimension, and even though they are very long."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"September 1, 2024","The book is broken into chapters that are not always continuous, this being said, Murakami manages to paint something beautiful even if the action is non-linear. I would put this as the first between the 3 books that I’ve read from him, it has that trait that defines his books, even if I’m not always fond of the Kafkaesque space."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"July 25, 2023","Kafkaesque, chaotic, I never knew what would happen next, but I couldn't stop reading like an addict. I didn't enjoy the feeling of nothingness after being so emotionally invested in the book, only to be left with a feeling of incoherence."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"October 6, 2020",Kafkaesque. Delightfully weird.
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"May 14, 2024","I love Murakami!! so kafkaesque. I find this one to be similar to The Judgement, with its back room mazes and eerie supporting characters. Will be having spooky dreams tonight"
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"March 5, 2018","Reading a Murakami novel is like stepping into a lucid dream. The setting, characters, and events are realistic yet eerily off center. Anything can happen. Unlike Isabelle Allende or Gabriel García Márquez, Murakami doesn't write magical realism; rather, he's the very definition of Kafkaesque. Which is why I love his books so much. They transport me into another dimension, and even though they are very long (I believe Wind-Up Bird was around 900 pages), I find them gripping."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,2,"May 25, 2015","I really didn't like this book. That saddens me; Kafka on the Shore is wonderful, and I thought this would be equally good. But Kafka has direction, while Wind-Up Bird just felt aimless. Many ideas and themes are shared between the two books (and After Dark): isolation, the self, the connection between fantasy, dream, and reality, how connections between humans form and what they mean. This is certainly a novel of ideas. But in Wind-up Bird, they are only ideas. The characters seem lost, in a fog that's more Kafkaesque than Kafka on the Shore. And after 600 pages of wandering in the fog, it ends. One wonders if the May Kasahara, 16 year old girl who provides a chorus-like commentary on the events, isn't really the main character, rather than Toru Akada. May at least seems to come to some resolution at the end."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,3,"December 20, 2008","The story is somewhat otherworldly, though set in modern Tokyo. The grace and foreignness of the style complement the otherworldlyness of the story perfectly. It is a kind of gentle, slow motion, Kafkaesque story of Freudian dreams and what you can find at the bottom of an empty well."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,5,"January 26, 2017","I don't know what to think about this book or more appropriately, I will think about this book for some time to come. I'm going to keep this review short because it would be difficult to do any real justice to this book in the space allotted. I found it immersive. It is as Kafkaesque as anything Kafka himself wrote. The book is (in part) about an unemployed man who's marriage collapses and he begins a spiritual journey that involves his attempts to transcend time and space in the darkness at the bottom of a well. What is real sometimes becomes fuzzy. The book is full of strange characters who weave their way in and out of the protagonist's life and the strange events that happen(ed) to him and to them. The book is set in modern day Japan and the Japanese republic established in conquered Manchuria in the thirties and forties. We learn of some of the horrors that took place there and in the Soviet labor camps in which the Japanese POWs were interred after the war. This was interesting to me as a westerner who knows nothing about this history. I recommend it wholeheartedly for its thought provoking and emotion packed prose. If you can't tolerate ambiguity and view reading as a light entertainment and you like stories to be wrapped in neat little packages then this may not be for you. This book follows no formula or template and transcends all the genres it could be conceivably be lumped into. I really liked it."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,3,"February 17, 2017","“Kafkaesque”--a descriptor so overplayed by erudite blowhards that I have never used it. Until now. No term better captures the disorienting feeling Toru Okada experiences as unexplainable surreal events befall him. The novel is laden with mysterious women with sexual tension intertwined with an abusive legal bureaucracy asserting powerplay over Okada, all in a dreamlike sleepwalk. Just as in Kafka’s Metamorphosis, the protagonist takes on a new form, but other characters see nothing out of the ordinary. Another similarity is the heavy use of symbolism--so much that I can’t even begin to psychoanalyze it (for some reason--they key parts of the book take place when characters climb down into water wells). What I can say is that most of the action is storytelling--if not following Okada, the other characters narrate their lives to him. If I even tried to lay out the plot… it would never make sense in this review. It starts when the phone rings, and a mysterious woman insists Okada engage in phone sex. He no sooner hangs up, when another mysterious woman, a prophet of sorts, calls to help him find his lost cat. Then he hangs out with a psychopathic teenage girl (how Japanese! how creepy). But what he really needs to find is his wife, who has run away, and he makes it his mission to win her back. All the rest is, well..."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"June 17, 2011","The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, like many of Murakami's other novels, features a protagonist out on a strange wild goose chase that turns into a sort of Kafkaesque nightmare. This is a part detective story, part psychological thriller, part fairy tale, part science-fiction-meets-Lewis Carroll. It features a very ordinary man as its hero - a passive, affectless sort of guy with a lowly job and even lower expectations."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,4,"May 4, 2014","On the surface this is an oddly told story of a marital breakup in contemporary Tokyo. But Murakami's post-modern experiment shatters the bits of the foreground story, like shards of a broken mirror, bringing into the mix an elaborate back story about the Japanese-Russian conflict during WWII in Manchuria, political and psycho-social intrigue involving family members, politics and scandal, a slew of mysterious women who may or may not be figments of our protagonist's imagination, and some undisclosed spiritual or erotic practices in a house known for the suicide of its occupants. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yes, the neighbor girl who leaves town to work in a factory and throws epistolary interruptions into the mix. At one point in this lengthy book I was bouncing back between paper, Kindle, and Audible, which I think enhanced the fragmented narrative structure. The actual unrolling of his scenes is extremely accessible and very entertaining, even in the midst of the Kafkaesque narrative goings-on."
The Wind Up Bird Chronicle,2,"September 26, 2013","Kafkaesque and unsatisfying. I occasionally had the feeling that there was some complexity going on that I just couldn't figure out, but given the choice of concluding that 1) I'm too stupid to understand or 2) a lot of the apparent symbolism and complexity is really just weirdness, red herrings, and loose ends, I opted for the latter. There are certainly pieces of this that touch on things that feel true about the world - that it is often incomprehensible and absurd, that each person is fundamentally alone and unknowable to others, etc. - but in the end that's not enough for me to enjoy it or feel like it's worthwhile. All the same, a pretty fast read."
Wittgenstein s Nephew,4,"August 14, 2024","I liked this: the Kafkaesque setting, the acid humor, the Nietzschean attitudes (a couple of sick supermen) a sneer against the dying of the light. I understand the title, but it made me keep looking under the bedpan for the philosopher."
the fellowship of the ring,5,"April 9, 2025","Tolkien says something interesting in his introduction. He says that after writing the draft of the book (with his own hand with pen and paper) he had to type it and retype it. He says that he did it himself because he couldn't afford the cost of professional typing. If Tolkien were alive today, he would be laughing at the irony of it all – he conceptualized the whole story and created a rich imaginary world, the likes of which no one had ever done before, and he wrote down the whole story himself with his own hand and he typed it himself because he couldn't afford the cost of professional typing. And many years later someone comes and makes a movie out of it and they make 3 billion dollars out of it. Tolkien would have been amused by it all, I'm sure. It is almost Kafkaesque. We all know, of course, that this is called capitalism. You come up with a new, unique idea, and someone will buy it from you for peanuts, and then they'll build an empire out of it."
one flew over the cuckoo s nest,4,"May 15, 2015","The ending of the book is no less powerful, quite Kafkaesque in its tragedy if you ask me, but probably absolutely necessary for the message to get across."
the 100 year old man who climbed out the window and disappeared,5,"September 15, 2021","One thing I immediately loved are the biographic chapters taken from earlier years of the protagonist’s life sprinkled in between the plot. Allan loved such an interesting, nearly kafkaesque life - it’s simple mesmerising! I kind of admire his stoic attitude towards life, it is unsettling and yet calming at the same time. Throughout his lifetime, there were so many situations in which he could have died but he survived time-and-time again. No matter what happened, he just went with it. “Things are what they are, and whatever will be, will be.”"
do androids dream of electric sheep,3,"April 29, 2020","Blade Runner affected my expectations for sure. This was different and then more similar to the movie than I thought it would be as I was reading it. It had good and bad moments; I was intrigued at the Kafkaesque parts with Garland and Resch and then taken out of it by the moments that reminded me this was written by a guy in the 1960s. But the sci-fi parts were interesting to read while social distancing in 2020 considering this was written in the 1960s, I guess? Gonna go read up on the internet’s opinion on this book!"
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"September 3, 2021","I liked the book, but it was very strange on some places. It almost had a kafkaesque characters to it, especially in the end. A lot of things are happening very rapidly. With no explanation. However, here it is a bit more out of character and it is harder to just ride the madness. You have to deeply think about the meaning. And sometimes this is more of a wishful thinking than actual uncovering of the meaning."
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"May 14, 2021",It’s very Kafkaesque in showing a person through their environment – showing their attitude toward living and life this way.
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"July 7, 2022","Philosophical fiction to ponder on the ethics of AI/Android. A man is a bounty hunter that gets paid to kill androids that has escaped mars where they where essentially slaves. He convinced himself that what he is doing is ethical as androids are non-living. It is interesting because the setting it took place believed in the ethics of non killing, even a little bug. As the story goes on, he becomes unsure of what he is doing. Very Kafkaesque"
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"June 1, 2025","Dick begins by offering us an uncanny short-circuit between free will and determinism, in the idea of having the ability to control one's own mood settings: Deckard's wife sets for herself a cyclical depression cycle because she feels it right to do so, as if it's the only ""natural"" thing to do - in any case, I think she finds the opportunity to ponder the nihilistic void ""therapeutic,"" in some sense. So in a way, we could say that the couple creates its own problem that it then must set out to solve - but in a psychoanalytic register, couldn't we claim that this is just the universal structure of desire? From this perspective, technology cannot actually transcend our human nature (a theme we will see return later), and there is even a ""gendered"" reading here (regarding periodical hormonal cycling). In any case, the rest of the story mostly revolves around a fictionalized version of the Turing test, that now-classic question of the boundary between the human and the machinic. The title points to this most explicitly: do androids have an unconscious? But there is almost a second question lurking here, for the ""biologic"" goat becomes a (classed) status symbol against the electric sheep. There's an environmentalist theme in the dystopianism presented here also, but it also recapitulates the second-class status of the androids. In a rather Kafkaesque sequence, Deckard's surety (of his own status as human, of the distinction between humans and androids) is called into question, a Cartesian motif that will be emphasized much more prominently in the film adaptations (especially Villeneuve's). In this sense, the perspective offered here is ineluctably masculine, and this is redoubled through the idea that human men can only extend empathy to android-kind through their desire to copulate with the female models. It's realistic enough as a conceit, and it at least somewhat troubles that rough-and-ready distinction that has come to be termed Madonna-whore. Yet this form of ""empathy,"" ""identification"" even, is ultimately false, and this can be seen in Deckard's fulfilling of his mission. In any case, I would argue that, far from extending empathy, this entry point can only serve to further dehumanize (via literalized objectification). Overall, I think this work is a compelling exploration of the male psyche, forwarding that it centers around that particular circling around the category of the moral (especially via those theological notions of sacrifice and the messianic)."
do androids dream of electric sheep,5,"April 23, 2022","I really enjoyed this! Definitely very different than Blade Runner, and as the cover of my copy describes it, Kafkaesque (in a good way)!"
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"January 12, 2024","It has been a long time coming reading this book. I have loved Blade Runner since the 80’s. Rick Dekkard of the book has a different feel to him though. He is such a worried, Kafkaesque little man. The androids are also very much less heroic than the movie, particularly Roy Batty. That said I loved this book. Phillip K Dick is a magnificent weirdo who has written some amazing books. So glad I finally got around to reading it 40 years on."

do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"February 22, 2015","Electric Sheep is a deep book wearing the mask of a shallow book, but, in the end, it is only half a mask (the Mercerism plum line cannot be hidden). For those expected a by-the-numbers noire, it's there in spades (Sam Spades, one might say), but everything about the animals and Mercerism might feel strange and out of place. For those expected a scifi, Kafkaesque story involving robots, we've got your alienated protagonist undergoing a mystical transformation right here."
do androids dream of electric sheep,3,"November 3, 2014","I read this back in college and didn't like it. Rereading it for a book group, I spent the first half wondering what had been wrong with me back then, but when I got to the second half, I realized my younger self had been absolutely correct. Dick had some cool ideas, but he didn't do anything with them. I mean, at one point he introduces us to the possibility of two police departments operating in a single city without knowing about each other, which opens up the possibility of some really twisted, Kafkaesque surrealism. But Dick drops the idea a couple chapters later by having it turn out to be a trick by the bad guys. He comes up with the idea of people using machines to induce artificial emotions, which could've raised some interesting questions about what it means to be human and what separates us from the androids, but in the end the androids turn out to have the moral development of a five year old pulling wings off flies, so the issue about humanity never gets any play. And on, and on."
do androids dream of electric sheep,4,"January 23, 2016","I liked it. Read it as a post-apocalyptic classic, but really the Sci-Fi and postapocalyptic aspects are just frames for an analysis of the meaning of individual vs. society, self-consciousness, and other topics. Fascinating to look at what the future looked like in the '60s. This work imagines a civilization that could create androids with organic bodies and sophisticated AI, but still using paper and carbon copies. Dick takes on a huge set of existential themes here, examining the roles of intelligence and empathy in self-awareness, the role of religion in society and to individuals (think Nietzsche), the inherent conflict between individual and societal needs, and much more. He wraps in in a bizarre Kafkaesque but entertaining story. He's playful with language; I love the ""Penfield Stimulator"", presumably named after the neurosurgeon, and the references to Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky, when a character named Borogrove deals with a cat that shortly before ""gurgled and blew bubbles, its vidleness glassy, its metal jaws locked together"". I'll have to go watch Blade Runner when I have a chance."
do androids dream of electric sheep,5,"December 12, 2022","Coming to this book with expectations that it would bear some resemblance to the movie Blade Runner, I was shocked... shocked and amazed. Blade Runner is a great film, but is very different from this book, which has less of a hard-boiled detective feel; rather it's immersed in Kafkaesque absurdity and dark ruminations on the nature—and limits—of humanity."
do androids dream of electric sheep,5,"February 27, 2015","Philip K. Dick was a genius and his influence cannot be undone or overlooked.

The Tenant,5,"March 4, 2025","The Tenant ( Le Locataire chimérique): Roland Topor transports us into the macabre word of Kafkaesque surrealism: In an apartment of almost blasé desolation, the neighbours are looming, and Trelkovsky “the tenant” is in distress. A perpetual visceral ordeal is shaking Trelkovsky’s tranquillity, driving him mental. “THEY” are watching! “THEY” want him - “THEY” want to transform him &gt; Enter the void of insanity: The reality indistinguishable of the nightmare, his senses out of step with his body, and the Metamorphosis is complete."
The Tenant,3,"October 5, 2015","Is Trelkovsky truly a victim of a complex conspiracy? Who is he, exactly? Trelkovsky is not a French name, as his landlord points out while interrogating him about his background - we learn that he was born in France, but nothing more. It is possible that Topor wanted Trelkovsky to reflect his own background - that of a Polish Jew, a stranger in the country of his birth(incidentally, Roman Polanski is also a Polish Jew who moved to Paris to live and work). That Trelkovsky is an outsider is obvious enough, but he himself also does not know who or what he is. Although he states that he is not a homosexual, he is unable to form a relationship with a woman; in fact he shows to be fascinated not with women, but with their bodies. As the novel progresses, Trelkovsky sees an increasingly clear image of himself as an intruder - not only in the claustrophobic, kafkaesque apartment complex, but inside his own body."
The Tenant,5,"November 6, 2011","In trying to be a good citizen and not disturb the neighbours, he manages first to erase himself from the Book of Individuality and then, in complete fail mode with respect of the Pareto principle, continues to persevere in his Sisyphean task until he morphs, Kafkaesque, into...a woman. Which is just his cocoon phase for a full blown transgender, trans-temporal, astral projection into ....yup, the tenant (absolutely brilliant, this), but not the tenant that he currently is, no, the tenant that he ‘was’ , or perhaps into the reincarnation of the latter (Carlos Castaneda, we need you here), or even, in a loop-de-loop, the tenant that he always will be in this perpetual Groundhog Day extravaganza."
The Tenant,5,"January 8, 2016","I think those who appreciate Aickman, the more absurd Kafkaesque side of Ligotti as demonstrated in Teatro Grottesco and Camus's The Stranger will find a lot to like--I know I did. The 1966 translation I read was very fluid and natural. The style like the story itself begins unassumingly enough and gradually ends up where it does, with you--the reader--wondering: how did I (and Trelkovsky) end up here? Nice open-ended ending---is it purely psychological horror or something (even) more sinister?"
The Tenant,5,"July 14, 2021",Masterful psychological horror and Kafkaesque to the core. Not only does Trelkovsky experience paranoid isolation as per The Trial but he even undergoes his own metamorphosis.
The Tenant,4,"October 9, 2021",A very Kafkaesque story.
The Tenant,3,"July 14, 2024","Topor’s writing takes some surrealist affordances which detract from what made Kafka’s writing so great. Suspicion of an unreliable, mentally-afflicted speaker (on account of Trolkovsky’s deranged, schizophrenic perceptions) distances the reader from Trolkovsky’s adversities, and thus offers a respite from the displacement, lowliness, and suffering of the novel—features which are comparatively inescapable in Kafka. Either we trust Trolkovsky, and the neighbours are explicitly malevolent in a manner which undermines the alienating uncertainty of the Kafkaesque; or we distrust Trolkovsky, and the entire story reads as the misnarration of a tragic schizophrenic episode."
The Tenant,5,"December 5, 2023","Main themes which are brought up in this novel are - Alienation, losing-self, isolation and of course that thin line between sanity and madness. To me, this was an interesting read, because executing a horror novel without any monsters, zombies, gore or superstitious-made-up stuff is simply amazing. It just moves away from traditional horror tropes in a way, going onto more Kafkaesque, psychological territory, which I'm a sucker for."
The Tenant,4,"May 30, 2021","A Kafkaesque book about alienation and paranoia, The Tenant tells the story of Trelkovsky as he moves inside a new apartment, in Paris, after the former tenant threw herself out the window. Followed by her specter and some strange occurrences with his new neighbors, his mental health starts to shatter more and more as he constantly plays the perpetual victim against the oppression from outside his comfort zone."

Atlas Shrugged,2,"February 4, 2020","Having read through the book, it really felt like Ayn Rand was creating not merely a fictional world - but a mythical one - to propound her philosophies. It felt like I was reading, or listening, about weird Kafkaesque-character-impersonators in a business setting. So the book was not just a book, it was more of a sermon. And Scott Brick's sombre, mildly hypnotic tone was suited well for that."

good morning midnight,5,"August 9, 2011","So, the main character Sasha wanders around Paris in this unblinking haze of past events that she can't escape from which continually make her bawl out loud in public places; in her case, nostalgia doesn't always present a Photoshopped image. Her current life circumstances are precarious—she's essentially penniless, living in some kind of cramped, dimly lit Kafkaesque hostel with a perverted neighbor and can't keep any job. In addition to being recently divorced, Sasha feels like she's losing her sanity, her youth and beauty. Quite gloomy. She blocks everything out with a heady combination of liquor and luminal."
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,4,"June 2, 2016","""For many of the students, this withholding created a Kafkaesque situation in which they saw they were to be punished for failure to do something but no one would tell them what they were supposed to do."""
The Magic Mountain,5,"January 9, 2022","Upon entering the sanatorium, Hans Castorp recognises it as being an unusual place surrounded by “eternal snow”. The institution is led by two eccentric medical practitioners Dr Behrens and Dr Krokowski, and their practices soon work magic on our flabbergasted visitor. Firstly, there is a strict regime to be followed at the sanatorium which produces “magical” results: there are lavish breakfasts, lunches and dinners to be had at the cafeteria, a variety of “cures” on offer for those sick followed by periods of rest and relaxation, which may then be followed up with intellectually and emotionally-steering lectures. In the evening, there is another delight – one can build a pyramid out of blankets for oneself on a balcony and stay star-gazing in a chilly air all through the night. Finally, in the basement there is also a “magic” X-ray machine which is capable of making transparent anything hidden to a naked eye. In sum, temptations are at every corner, both for the body and the mind, and soon the routine of the place proves irresistible to our hero to starts falling in love with the life of constant leisure. He has no defences against the pleasures of intellectual talks with friends and the soothing softness of the reclining chair. Hans Castorp may be showing first signs of an illness, but sociologist Erving Goffman (1922 – 1982) and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (1920 – 2021) also wrote of institutions in general comparing them to those communities that control their residents through rituals and monotony, putting them into the state of perpetual Kafkaesque uncertainly, surreptitiously brainwashing them and instilling in them the fear of, and aversion towards change of any kind. Berghof seems to be an institution that is prepared to run your life for you."
The Magic Mountain,3,"October 26, 2019","Hans Castorp visits his cousin at a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps. What begins as a three-week visit turns into a seven-year stay. Essentially, his journey is a foray into the life of the mind, of ideas instead of the materialism of the ""flatlands,"" where the rat-race of everyday society reigns. Castorp is an Everyman, essentially a blank slate of curiosity, eager to soak in ideas and act as mediator. In the beginning, the novel reads almost as Kafkaesque, with Castorp given the run-around from various doctors about the state of his health and the length of his stay. Mann presents the ephemerality of life to the reader by juxtaposing Castorp's willingness to stay and become a student of the world with his cousin, Ziemssen, who against doctor's orders returns to his life in the flatlands to see through his tour of duty. The characters who remain with Castorp represent European pre-war ideas in a microcosm. Settembrini is a man of the world, of language and literature and philosophy; Naptha is the religious zealot; Madame Chauchat is love and temptation; Peeperkorn is hedonism. Through his conversations, interactions, and walks through the idyllic Swiss scenery with these characters, Castorp slowly imbibes the magic. Unfortunately, much of the novel reads in this manner, almost like two or more academics discussing their theses with a young apprentice. I appreciated what Mann was going for, but I didn't have the patience for it once I understood what the characters represented. There were some nice twists, however, to keep things interesting."
The Magic Mountain,4,"July 29, 2016","I finally finished The Magic Mountain about our aimless young Hans Castorp, who visits his cousin at a tuberculosis sanitorium in the Swiss Alps and, in a Kafkaesque twist, ends up staying there for seven years because of a mild fever. Reading the book was like catching a mild fever (in a good way), and, in taking more than a year to finish it (I was reading many other books), I feel that I, too, absurdly overstayed the length of my visit."
Picnic at Hanging Rock,4,"February 20, 2015","With so much hype, I feel positively brimming with comments and compliments on the text and Peter Weir's film. PICNIC is a remarkable work on both the page and screen due to its elusiveness. The approach will surely irk some, but it is one of the finest examples of style over substance, as it evokes an alluring Kafkaesque dread of the insolvable and unanswerable through juxtaposition of beauty and brutality. Obviously the novel contains deeper characterizations and a bit more humor, but Weir and screenwriter Cliff Green are incredibly faithful to the text by threading necessary scenes like dream-weavers, respecting Joan Lindsay's exemplary graceful evasiveness to conventional clues of the looming mystery. Instead of a chronicle of a disappearance of three boarding school girls and their mathematics teacher during an afternoon picnic, the novel and film are more concerned with this sort of mystic aura or figurative ""pattern,"" as Lindsay begins to put it at the beginning of chapter ten. PICNIC is surrealism without explicitly plunging into those depths, a thriller without quite exhibiting the genre's trajectory, and erotica without the bearing of a naked body. What could be more maddening and memorable?"
Coraline,4,"February 19, 2024","As is the usual with Gaiman, Coraline excels with its masterful blend of our world with another magical world; the difference this time being the particular magical world that imposes on our own in Coraline is actually quite horrific. Coraline for the most part feels like a fever dream. It’s the trippiest of Gaiman’s worlds that I’ve experienced, even moreso than London Below in Neverwhere. Coraline herself is an endearing character; her bravery in the face of a Kafkaesque world and situation is especially so. The book to me felt like a combination of the gothic vibes of The Graveyard Book, the mind-fuck world of Neverwhere, and the melancholy of Ocean at the End of the Lane - complete with an antagonist that is reminiscent of Ursula from that particular book. Despite there being much to love about this book, with pretty much nothing to criticise; it lacked the enjoyment I got from my favourite Neil Gaiman books in The Ocean at the End of the Lane and The Graveyard Book. Whilst Coraline is a very good story, I can’t help but compare it to those and it just isn’t quite on the same level as those two, for me."

The Crucible,3,"April 28, 2017","Then late in Act II I took a break and read some of the GR reviews, noting how many people pointed out and objected to the aforementioned trap. Keeping this in mind as I read the rest, I found myself viewing Proctor very differently, and Elizabeth too for justifying &amp; encouraging his excesses of ego. In fact I can think of few characters at all who aren't in some way damned by their own stubborn adherence to principle - though for some, at least, this says less about them and more about the punitive (dare I say Kafkaesque?) circumstances into which they are thrown."

kafka,4,"August 5, 2024","I am no art person so I have no idea how to exactly describe the art style of the sibling duo, Nishioka Kyoudai, in their graphic adaptation of Kafka. However, I do know that it perfectly captures the Kafkaesque vibe and gives me the same bleak, eerie and strange feelings as Franz Kafka’s original stories."
kafka,5,"December 3, 2023","Kafka lends himself to graphic representation. This is the third one I've read (after Kafka and Kafkaesque: Fourteen Stories) and is the best of the three. It has The Metamorphosis, The Hunger Artist, In the Penal Colony, and six other stories--some published during Kafka's lifetime and some unpublished. All are done in black-and-white with lots of artistry on each page and a well chosen (very small subset) of Kafka's language. Not the insect himself is not depicted in The Metamorphosis, he's just a lump under the covers etc. Some of the more obscure stories were also weird to the point of one wasn't entirely sure why one was reading them, but these two were enjoyable nonetheless. And it added a lot to the more familiar stories."
kafka,3,"September 16, 2023","The art style and the Kafkaesque aesthetic match quite well for most of the short stories. However, the first one was very hard to grasp in an e-copy since the alignment was wonky. Also, the short stories I have previously read in the original form seemed to be more enjoyable than the ones I read for the first time, which seems to be a 'me' problem. The 9 shorts consisted of Kafka's most popular novel and some of the more obscure ones."
kafka,5,"October 4, 2023","This is a short story collection of Franz Kafka’s works depicted as a graphic novel by Nishioka Kyōdai. There is a quality to Kafka’s works which lends itself to the term “Kafkaesque” most of all - the quality of a world with apathy towards absurdity, of which Kafka’s main character is often suffering. Often this quality is shown through undefined characters or central features of the story. For instance, the main character of Metamorphosis isn’t quite turned into a cockroach - that’s just how most readers attribute him; at least, the readers who feel a need to identify him. In the text, however, he is just a bug of senseless creation and therefore senseless identity. To take Kafka’s work, which lacks this determined visual nature to it and intend to capture it all the same, is an interesting feat. How Kyōdai chooses to depict Metamorphosis in this regard is brilliant. The first short story tackled addresses that very feeling in an item, the Odradek, which is explained by Kafka in quite painstaking detail and yet indescribable without so many words and still without purpose. This feels like a similar artistic drive to that of Magritte’s, one of my favorite artists, who created Treachery of Images. Magritte pokes at the difference between words titling an object and the object itself - a pipe is only a pipe because you say it is, so to say. As is the Odradek only undefinable and useless because of our determination. How Kafka-esque, and how apt a way to poke at his work’s finest quality, “The entire form appears useless, yet somehow complete.” I find a stronger connection in the art style to Edward Gorey’s work than Junji Ito, as it was referenced in the provided summary. Like Gorey’s work, this book has dense, static backgrounds that feel claustrophobic at times, capturing the industrial influence in Modernist works effectively. While Ito’s work would accurately capture the industrial influence, as well, the lithographic appearance of both Gorey and Kyōdai’s work here help to place the stories in Kafka’s time. I found the stories to be appropriately retold, but I would still recommend readers to Kafka’s writing before picking this up. Kafka is a favorite author of mine, and I chose this ARC with glee - it is truly a phenomenal rendition of his works."

The Sunset Limited,3,"December 16, 2024","The dialogue is quite particular to two specific characters, casting the light of believabilty on the encounter. At the same time, however, this is a philosophical dialogue. The White's worldview is Kafkaesque.

welcome to night vale,4,"August 13, 2021","This was one strange book. Surreal. Kafkaesque. And wildly entertaining. It’s based on a podcast about a desert town with very strange residents and happenings. I’ve never listened to it. This book was recommended by a friend (thanks Will!). There are two more books in the trilogy which I picked up cheap. It was nominated for a British Fantasy Award in the Horror category, though it’s only mildly horror in that there’s at least one ghost. It’s going to be hard to talk about this book because it is so weird, but I’ll give a go."

""Welcome to Night Vale"" has a clear niche audience and you will either love this book or quit very quickly because you're a dick and you don't get it. Night Vale takes everything about novels, basic logic and simple situations and stretches them into ground breaking reflections that change the way I look at writing. It's the type of book that makes you stop a lot after sentences and think ""Holy shit that's genius and funny, how come i didn't think of that."" great stuff, fun to read short chapters that help propel you through this fun and interesting world"

Lanark,4,"March 24, 2009","Lanark is really two stories: the story of the title character’s fumbling attempts to find love and enjoy life in a Kafkaesque future Glasgow; and the mid-twentieth-century coming-of-age story of a boy, Thaw, who is similarly alienated from society and the female sex, and is driven mad by a yearning for these things. These two tales have only the most tenuous of connections."
Lanark,5,"June 4, 2023","Wow. What a book. A wild ride of plot, character, time, setting and skewed perspective, shaken up in a Kafkaesque snow globe, with a sprinkling of Gormenghast and Iain Banks thrown in. I’m glad I read it. It’s one of my books of the year. But I probably wouldn’t recommend you read it, unless you liked Kafka’s The Castle, Gormenghast and probably Ulysses too."
Lanark,5,"April 12, 2025","How to pin this down? This is one of those books that’s sat on my shelf for many years and from snatches I’ve heard about it over those years, left me too daunted by its scale and scope to start it. But I’m glad I finally did. It’s playful and thought-provoking and by the time it expands its meta scope through autofiction and eventually more overt authorial intervention, it left me astounded. It’s just constantly upending your expectations of it, unafraid to puncture its own reputation in the midst of consuming it. It feels very much like what it is: a patchwork assembled from separate entities but still absolutely fitting as a whole — even while the disparate parts do still feel disparate. Sci-fi/fantasy? Governance metaphor? Erotic reverie? Kafkaesque administrative dystopia? Bildungsroman? A potted history of modern Glasgow replete with allegory? All of the above. An experience unlike any other I’ve had with a book. On the surface, that’s to do with its irregular structure and rhythms but every element from notions of nationalism to the protagonist being a proto-incel still feels directly relevant. And any page featuring Gray’s artwork is a joy."
Lanark,4,"May 26, 2020","I thought of this correspondence while reading Lanark, parts of which I devoured with what Aristotle termed ""the joy of recognition"". (The good parts are so, so good, and the bad parts forgivably, excitingly so; only the endless bloat of Book 4 finally pushed me into dropping a star.) The young artist Duncan Thaw, and his alter ego Lanark, are needy and anxious, fixated on an inner artistic vision, but also arrogant and entitled. They have catastrophic relationships with women. The book nests a brilliant bildungsroman, suffused with penury and the gloom of the Scottish soul, inside a surrealist nightmare world with both a dream's illogic and its manifold echoes of the waking life seen in the middle section. (These reminded me of the similarly Kafkaesque unease in Anna Kavan's Ice, and the series of calamities compressed in time of Robert Coover's short story Going for a Beer.)"
Lanark,4,"May 4, 2018","That sounds cute and playful, but _Lanark_ is not just messing around. Books 3&amp;4 are a Kafkaesque science-fiction dystopia in which a forlorn, bewildered man is batted around an increasingly incomprehensible and dire world whilst really just looking for someone who will be nice to him without then immediately hating and hurting him. Books 1&amp;2 are a frankly horrifying autobiographic bildungsroman about a young man who wants to have sex and be an artist, but is so unreflectively selfish that he makes everyone who tries to help him grow to despise him. There is a painful intimacy of sexual and emotional detail which recalls those nightmares where you do something really embarrassing in front of a girl you like and then absolutely everyone laughs at you and she just looks really disgusted at the idea that you might like her. Sniping through all this, minor secondary characters will occasionally and incidentally snap off precise, deadly lines about exactly what is really wrong with Thaw (/Alisdair/you)."
Lanark,4,"December 23, 2020","A beautifully messy novel that is unafraid to be anything but its sui generis self. As kafkaesque, lynchian, and surreal as it is mundane, quotidian, and realist, and Gray takes on capitalism, war, death, bureaucracy, intimacy, literature, intertextuality, plagiarism, art, religion, and a whole lot more through a very specifically Scottish lens. Find a copy and get on it!"
Lanark,2,"January 12, 2025","The surrealist Books are very Kafkaesque - too much so for me as an admirer of Kafka! These Books seem to represent a mythologised and exaggerated, dream-like, alternative reality where character traits and disabilities are transferred to multiple different situations and characters. E.g. Thaw’s (who’s called Lanark in these Books) inability to form stable relationships with women is transferred to a multi-amorous and self-confident character called Sludden. Thaw’s ailments become grotesque transformative transmogrifications. One of the many women he has the hots for in his actual life, Marjorie, becomes the enigmatic companion Rima. And so on, and so forth… However, for the most part I didn’t understand Gray’s allegories and metaphors, which I thought a bit pretentious and unnecessary. In typical postmodern fashion, these seem to aim at clumsy obfuscation instead of simple and elegant clarity. Especially towards the end of the book I had no idea what the narrative was about, including the truly strange ‘Epilogue’ with its section on “embedded plagiarisms”! After a while I found it pretty tedious to wade through all the mumbo-jumbo, not to put too fine a point on it."
Lanark,4,"July 26, 2019","The main problem with the novel is its aimlessness. The protagonist(s) doesn't really know what he wants or where he's going, and readers can't be sure what goal the novel wants to achieve. Since the conflicts seem to frequently shift and rarely (if ever) get resolved, the novel, throughout and ultimately, is unsatisfying. This becomes extremely frustrating in the fourth book when the Kafkaesque absurdities eventually begin to feel like a cheap trick to keep the story going rather than a meaningful development of the plot. Another problem is Gray's depiction of women as universally irrational, unpredictable, and frequently cruel, one of the frustrations of the novel that, with constant reiterations, becomes a severe annoyance. It might be an exaggeration to call his portrayal of female characters misogynistic, but it surprises me that I haven't seen that suggested in any reviews so far."
Lanark,4,"July 12, 2021","Lanark charts the life and afterlife of a depressed, quite misogynistic Glaswegian art student. In his afterlife, he finds himself in a Kafkaesque version of Glasgow, a post-industrial landscape of endless night, populated by dole queues, bohemians and orphans. It is self-indulgent but also unashamedly political, endlessly inventive, and quite quite beautiful."
Lanark,4,"December 10, 2021",A Kafkaesque story that mixes autobiographical background from Gray’s childhood in Glasgow with fantasy like Terry Gilliam’s Brazil. There are some wonderful set pieces such as the hospital treating patients who are gradually turning into mythical grand statues and the atmospheric fog shrouded road in between places where one side goes uphill and the other down.

Naked Lunch,5,"June 6, 2021","a modern epileptic epic filled with rabelaisian humor and the dark irony of 20th-century absurdists; an unstructured tale of addiction, violence, death and sex (always intertwined), blood and desire, populated with addict policemen, surgeons, runaways, men and women joined by the same relentless thirst for heroin, cocaine, opium and other — always more destructive — drugs. here the paranoïa and hallucinations given by “junk” come to life, three-ways and orgies lead to necks being snapped, an island places justice in the hands of random citizens in some sort of kafkaesque dystopia, surgery leads to a live monkey being sewn into a man’s chest, or even to a complete restructuration of the human body close to the maddening obsession of Shelley’s Dr. Frankenstein... with an exquisite writing style Burroughs heightens the blossoming senses and twisted thoughts that come with feeding one’s body and mind with enchanted substances full of death and agony; with a delectable sense of humor he expresses the horror and violence which constitute the everyday life of any gay man, drag queen or “queer”, any junky and any black person who dares to exist in 20th-century America — more than a novel about drugs, it’s a novel about the raw cruelty with which the “lowest” people (i.e. marginalized people) are often (almost always) treated."

Naked Lunch,4,"June 2, 2021","Upon finishing the book I revisited a middle chapter titled “The Examination”, which highlights (I would argue) an Achilles-heel to this otherwise extraordinary book. The chapter is a 10 page anecdote with the unknown Carl and the all-to-familiar Dr. Benway. The episode sprawls into Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucracy and disease, all coalescing in a shocking conclusion. The chapter is one of Burrough’s finest but nonetheless exacerbated what I felt was a mild lack of versatility in the novel’s otherwise immaculate prose. This problem is largely present in the first half and mostly alleviates itself by chapters such as “Coke Bugs”. If one were to isolate a tone for monotone, I would hope they pick one that reeks as much as this."
Naked Lunch,4,"May 3, 2025","An Ostensibly grotesque and superfluously pornographic book that feels like its relishing in its debauchery and filth. Its easy to read this book and think its just the sordid orgiastic fantasies of a depraved individual and that is slightly true but there is so much more to the book. It reminds me a lot of John Water's 'Pink Flamingos' as i believe it comes from the same line of thinking, it is a holistic response to our anachronistic society and bureaucracy. Burroughs manages to create a Kafkaesque putrid nightmare of commerce, control, and power. Drugs (junk) end up being emblematic of capitalism and commerce itself, showing the power structure between a dealer and user and liking that to capitalism and class divide. Its an incredibly audacious and brave book that i respect a hell of a lot but is it extremely uncomfortable and disturbing to read. It is completely debauched and sordid in every page, to the page it gets absurd and obscene with its anatomical negligent body horror that would even surprise Cronenberg. A hard read but an amazingly intelligent book"

Junky,5,"February 12, 2012","Junky is nearly sıxty years old and, unlike other books by Burroughs, remains as vivid and powerful as ever.The others have a strong element of Kafkaesque, trainspotting, psychodelic paranoia, but this one is dry and understated - the record of how you live, how you score and who you meet when you live by junk, and what it's like without it. Keenly and dispassionately observed, without a shred of moral judgement. Burroughs never tries to say what junk feels like. It's like one of those old Hollywood films where the source of the horror is always offstage."
Letter to His Father,3,"February 16, 2016","This letter however, precisely for its confessional aspect and for the sophisticated language, is a necessary read for anyone interested in Kafka’s works. Themes of irrational authority, alienation of the individual, obsessive fears, disorienting perceptions, inability to control one’s life, debilitating restrictions, etc, have their seeds in this letter. All these “Kafkaesque” elements were certainly in Franz’s mind. We do not know if their source was Hermann. And as Franz recognized little of the Kafka traits in himself, the term “Kafkaesque” may not be the most appropriate to refer to his idiosyncrasies."
Letter to His Father,5,"January 9, 2025","I find it rather ironic how we use the term 'Kafkaesque' to describe literature that falls under the umbrella of Kafka's style of expression when it seems to me that Kafka spent the majority of his life feeling as if he could not live up to the name, as if it carried with it this momentous weight that he could never fully shoulder, no matter how much effort he dedicated, and this only catalysed his consternation."
Letter to His Father,5,"April 2, 2023","incredibly sad and depressing. i felt uncomfortable and like an intruder at times because it’s such a raw and vulnerable letter, but at the same i’ve never related more. it’s a kafkaesque experience to read this book while listening to “Nantes” by Barbara (thanks christian! you’re responsible for my mental breakdown)"

Letter to His Father,5,"February 24, 2018","Kafka here isn't equivocal and baffling as he is in his novels. He is direct in his wrath and despair lashing out at his father, whom he believes is largely responsible, if not solely, for his severely damaged psyche.

They who read this letter, will be rewarded with the glimpses of the conception of 'Kafkaesque'."

This made me sad, but now I think I actually understand Kafka more and will be able to enjoy his other works in a different manner. He seems to have been a very peculiar man, but I relate to him in some ways. The fact that his father never got to read the letter just made the typical kafkaesque sense of helplessness all the more ironic. After all, these types of relationships often seem (or even are) simply irreparable."
Letter to His Father,4,"September 12, 2024",no wonder the word kafkaesque exists
Letter to His Father,5,"July 14, 2023","Kafka's letter was unsent. Insomuch as fiction derives from experience, Letter to My Father is a key document that may reveal some of the autobiographical underpinnings of Kafka's work: the appearance of totalitarian figures who presume your guilt, characters whose sheer physical presence may make one feel inadequate or as if one is encased in the carapace of an insect. ""Sometimes I imagine the map of of the world spread out and you stretched diagonally across it."" Given how all-encompassing his father appeared to him, it's to Kafka's credit that he populated a fictional universe of novels and stories, of parables and paradoxes, that is so nightmarish and credible that it has earned its own modifier: Kafkaesque."

Letter to His Father,4,"January 23, 2016","This Letter could have been an attempt to kill the symbolic father from which derived an existence of anguish and guilt conscience. Hence this letter is Kafka's ultimate way ( within his possibilities) to liberation of the shadow of his father and self realization as an individual. The sad thing is that the father never read the letter. This really gets you into the heart of Kafka, a damaged heart beyond repair. What does this book have to uncover about his other litterary works? maybe it gets you to see the source from which the Kafkaesque sense of dry and cold stupification comes from."
Letter to His Father,4,"January 21, 2013","This is not a simple book. This is not a book at all. This is a deep confession. ...perhaps, Kafka himself did not understand how much his father affected his personality, how much it meant in building the Kafkaesque inside of him... We would not have Franz Kafka - the writer, without his father. And this is probably the most frustrating part in loving Kafka."
Black Hole,3,"November 16, 2016","The art is stellar and the book itself is well done and tackles some pretty heavy shit, but I can't help but feel that I would have gotten much more out of it if I had been part of the target audience - a teenager undertaking his own kafkaesque transformation into adulthood. A lot of the themes do hit home retroactively, but it's not the same as a (mostly) well adjusted adult."
Our Mutual Friend,Not rated,"July 31, 2011","Of COURSE this gets five stars. They shouldn't even LET ordinary mortals rate this one. I agree with those who say that this and Bleak House are his two best. It doesn't quite have the philosophical and sociological heft or the Kafkaesque gloom of Bleak House, but I'm willing to revise that opinion as I let the whole creepy *water* thing marinate in my head for a few days or so. Not quite as many strong characters as in Bleak House, I must say. The best part about it, for me, was the theme of wealth and money and value that runs through it; in that respect, this is Dickens the sociologist at his best--not so much as a social documentarian and bird's-eye-view social analyst in the way that Trollope is, but in understanding the visceral heart of what it is that makes *things* and *identities* valuable. A great, great book."
Amerika,4,"December 9, 2024","The least Kafkaesque novel by Kafka—maybe that’s why it is more overlooked than his other works. Instead of the claustrophobic feel of helplessness, there is actually a sense of hope and comedic relief in the adventures of our hero, an innocent immigrant in 1920s America, as he pursues the american dream. Given that the outcome isn’t all that different despite the lighter tone—our hero becomes poorer instead of richer—perhaps it’s better to laugh than to despair over a system you can’t change."
Amerika,3,"March 4, 2011","If you know anyone who never shuts up about the darkness of his work, who throws around the term ""Kafkaesque with an excessive frequency, I recommend getting them a copy of this book."

Amerika,3,"April 5, 2020","Another review vanished! How Kafkaesque! Especially when it used to be called The Man who Disappeared. It's probably metamorphosised, gone on trial and banished to the goodreads penal colony."
Amerika,4,"August 6, 2016","This novel is completely different from all the others Kafka's works. I mean, it's not kafkaesque, it's picaresque. Amerika has something of Dickens and it doesn't seem written by an european novelist."
Amerika,2,"November 11, 2010",This is Kafka trying to write like Dickens. Bad. I like Kafka better when he is Kafkaesque.
Amerika,3,"October 5, 2023","Shame it wasn't finished, but I'm not sure it would have made much difference to me anyway seeing as it's far from his best work. Absurd misadventures across an imagined America, mostly taking place in the shroud of night; under the stars of a noirish twilight zone world, featuring a vulnerable protagonist encountering untrustworthy figures of authority along the way, sure did have the feel of a Kafka, and yet at the same time it was, after all the work I'd previously read by him, his most un-kafkaesque, due to the powerlessness and nightmarish claustrophobia some of his best known characters endure being replaced with overplayed humour. As a first effort it's certainly not bad, and can I see why others may love it, but for me there is no way it's hanging around inside my head like The Metamorphosis."
Amerika,5,"November 8, 2012","According to the preface of my edition Kafka wrote Amerika as a bit of a homage/response to the works of Charles Dickens (whom I personally can't stand, but then I dislike most Victorian era lit) and this is clear in the the depiction of the protagonist Karl Rossman who despite being used and abused by a good portion of the people he encounters, as well as being tread on by just plain unfortunate circumstances, never seems to quite lose his overall positive outlook on his new life in America. This is immediately tempered though by one of the factors that separates Kafka from Dickens. Karl possesses a nervous dread and self destructive thought process that usually permeates the atmosphere of Kafka's settings and where as a character/protagonist like Pip from Great Expectations has a guilt from his 'original crime' Karl's angst comes from a more existential source, that each encounter with every new character or challenge means a new chance for betrayal or abuse, with all blame for his pain to be placed squarely on his shoulders. Pip seems to be physically and mentally whole, while Karl, though bodily whole, is mentally an ever-shifting shambles of tempestuous over analysis and pain, distinctly Kafkaesque."
Amerika,5,"April 5, 2025","Just thinking about living like that is scary as hell. Not that our world is perfect, in fact I know quite a few people who come close to this strange ignorance of Kafkaesque characters (cough my boss cough) but just reading Amerika made me crazy anxious."
Amerika,2,"October 6, 2016","But of course, as if pre-empting dismissive readers like me in his time, Max Brod classified this work and the rest of Kafka’s efforts as surrealism and gave us the buzzword “Kafkaesque,” where reality gets suspended and “anything goes,” and the author’s whole collection of incomplete works was elevated to a new branch of high literature."
Amerika,5,"March 31, 2018","Kafka's incomplete and unfinished first novel follows guileless European emigree Karl Rossmann through the mistrials and misadventures of his early days in the United States. The theme of this novel and of the entire Kafka oeuvre is unjust persecution--and from the outset Karl finds himself interrogated and forced to justify himself in various untenable positions. (The first ""chapter"" of the novel is the well-known short story, The Stoker, in which Karl attempts to advocate for the title character against a bullying supervisor named Schubal.) Some of these interrogations and predicaments are cringe-inducing in a manner than can only be described as kafkaesque, especially those at the Occidental Hotel and with his abusive companions, Robinson and Delamarche, but they also have the flavor on vintage sitcoms with higher stakes. Think ""Three's Company"" set inside Gestapo headquarters. While Kafka's knowledge of American geography proves limited -- most notably, he describes a bridge connecting New York City to Boston -- he does capture the sensibility of early 20th century America without ever having crossed the Atlantic."
Amerika,2,"July 4, 2012","Partly it's the lunatic family politics. Again, it's Kafka, so you can't really pick stuff apart, but they all have scenes where the protagonist goes against his guardian's ""wishes"" and the supposed loving, supposed adult throws an infantile tantrum that sets up a significant part of the conflict for the rest of the book. Karl accepts his uncle's friend's emphatic invitation to his home over his uncle's mildly expressed reservation about how late and inconvenient it is, and is thus disowned and banished by letter delivered by third party. De Tocqueville had a whole section about how Americans don't feel the need to be petty tyrants over their families, so maybe that's just a Kafkaesque exaggeration of how things actually were/are for Euros, but I can't stand it, it just rings false."
Amerika,3,"February 26, 2025","What I absolutely loved about the book was that, although it wasn’t as depressing and Kafkaesque as his other works (who does not love the sadness of Kafka books?), it had incredible symbolism that tied all the different stories together, and it felt like a fever dream. It also had interesting parallels to his real life-there were always two characters who despised him and had something against him, symbolising or resembling his parents, or how the balcony had such a profound meaning for the main character (those who have read letters to father know how his father carried him out onto the balcony in only a nightshirt and locked him outside)"
Amerika,4,"June 19, 2020","Karl exists in a more realistic setting than characters in Kafka's other stories, yet the character doesn't develop realistically at all. As another reviewer put it, ""Karl [is] screwed over by fates that even the most lubberly of recreants could have avoided with little to no fancy footwork"". It's as if some among the traits of Kafka's style are here being used against him. The novel mixes the Kafkaesque and the non-Kafkaesque often not to its benefit. It sometimes feels as if Kafka's characters are somehow clinging to another writer's world."
Amerika,4,"September 8, 2021",Apparently the first Kafka book I decided to read after Metamorphosis (long time ago in university) is also the less Kafkaesque book that he wrote. Considering that I don't know much of his usual literature I can't compare it myself. Yet I due to Metamorphosis I always imagined Kafka style to be really bizarre. I think one can see this in the book as well only on a very low level. Karl's experience in Amerika takes place is a real world and seems to be a story of a real kid trying to make it in America and yet there is this weird feeling in events in each chapter that makes it seem a bit out of this real world as well.
Amerika,2,"January 15, 2018",Very different from the other work of Franz Kafka; only the final chapter is truly Kafkaesque.
Amerika,4,"September 25, 2017","Now I understand better the term ""Kafkaesque""."
Amerika,5,"December 21, 2024","Et c’est la tout le génie de Kafka. Parvenir à nous sensibiliser à son message. L’on pourrait sortir de cette lecture morose et défaitiste. Mais c’est l’inverse, Notre monde n’est pas encore kafkaesque, les injustices ont lieu et nous avons la possibilité de nous y opposer. Pour Karl, monsieur K, et tant d’autres nous devons aller de l’avant."
Amerika,4,"December 27, 2024","Een onvoltooid werk, hetgeen zich met name uit in de plotselinge finale. Ik genoot van dit boekje; er zit veel humor in en zelfs absurdisme. Kafkaesque thema's zijn eveneens zichtbaar, zoals het overweldigd worden door een (vijandige) buitenwereld, daar eigenlijk geen grip op kunnen krijgen, maar eerder een soort slachtoffer van worden. De imposante zangeres Brunelda is zowel een absurdistisch personage als een symbool voor de onberekenbaarheid van het (maatschappelijke, administratieve) systeem en de beklemming die daarvan uitgaat."
Amerika,4,"April 29, 2023","“The Man Who Disappeared” (sometimes entitled “Amerika”) was Franz Kafka’s first novel, published posthumously in 1927. Unlike some of his famous works, typical Kafkaesque nightmarish qualities are replaced by fractured, often comic vignettes. The main character is Karl Rossmann, a young teenage boy whose parents force him to immigrate from Prague to America. Many settings seem slightly askew, not surprising given that the author never set foot in the United States; this is an “Amerkca” rooted in Kafka’s imagination and perceptions. The first vignette takes place aboard the immigrant’s ocean liner docked in New York harbor after passing a Statue of Liberty holding a sword rather than a torch. The last story ends with Karl boarding a train wherein he “disappears” into the vast wilderness of America’s heartland (“Great Oklahama”). What meaning does Kafka attach to Karl’s maze-like escapades? The protagonist remains honest and industrious but seemingly lacking in direction. He ardently seeks to retain his freedom, but freedom to do what? The episodes have been described as a “presentation of puzzles without solutions.” At one point, Karl poignantly declares, “Yes, I’m free, . . . and nothing seemed more worthless.” This lack of purpose characterizes these stories and much of Kafka’s writings."
Amerika,5,"September 28, 2021","apart from Kafka's other story, this one is less ""Kafkaesque"" and easy to read. At age of 17, Karl Rossmann is forced to go to America by his parents as a punishment. There he is taken care of by his uncle but somehow he displeased his uncle and was forced to leave him and lead the life on his own. Though Kafka's stories are mostly unfinished and can be read as a draft or fragments, they are quite interesting in their own way."
Amerika,Not rated,"March 9, 2012","But there is the other side of the novel, that comes out only after one considers Kafka's individual situation in 1913, when 'The Stoker' was first written. Feeling trapped in his day-to-day life, unable to elevate himself above it all in his quest to write, Kafka stated that he was searching for something 'away from here, just away from here'; and where more obvious, more appealing, more vast and perfect, than America. Pre-Trial, pre-Metamorphosis even, this is Kafka before he was what we know today, or what many think they know as 'Kafkaesque', a word woefully over-utilized these days. Perhaps he wished to write himself out of a hole, perhaps he sought to unravel for himself the myth of the terrestrial paradise that had become America in the early 20th century, the 'melting pot' of opportunity, and did it in the only way he understood; through writing. As the novel remains unfinished, and as Hofmann points out in the introduction to my penguin version, it is impossible to estimate what kind of conclusion Kafka foresaw for the novel. There are those who view Amerika as a picaresque adventure through a blossoming nation, ending in certain resolution for Rossman; the idea of America as a place of infinite space and boundless possibility, juxtaposed with Kafka's usual themes, those of claustrophobia, tight-knit paranoia, certainly go against the less than uplifting ending to The Trial, and the pervading sense of futility that renders The Castle so unique. There is an also indication of this possible 'happy' ending from Kafka, who stated:"
Amerika,Not rated,"October 4, 2023",Amerika หรือ ชายผู้สาบสูญ ยังคงความ Kafkaesque ไว้เหมือนกับงานก่อน ๆ ของคาฟคา เป็นความแปลกประหลาดเหนือจริง ความโดดเดี่ยว ความแปลกแยก แต่น่าเสียดายที่หนังสือเล่มนี้เป็นผลงานที่จารมิจบ คาฟคาเสียชีวิตก่อนที่จะเขียนหนังสือเล่มนี้จบ อย่างไรก็ตาม Amerika ก็ยังเป็นผลงานที่มีคุณค่าในตัวมันเอง แม้จะเสียดายที่เรื่องนี้เขียนไม่จบ
Amerika,4,"June 3, 2025","With almost no 'Kafkaesque' in this book, it has a different feel to it. I'm stuck between this being a good entry point vs it being only for Kafka lovers. I think it's the latter as though the story is more digestible, his prose still makes it feel dense and would possibly be off putting. There are some high and some low parts but he is my GOAT, so I enjoyed the entire thing, but 'A Country House near New York' is ridiculously good and a peak into his greatest."
Amerika,2,"October 22, 2020",This was my first Kafka and maybe it wasn't the best choice considering the book remained unfinished by Kafka. A little glimpse into Kafkaesque motifs I am told but the story read more like one of those picaresque early 20th century mavericks trying to make it in the New World despite many obstacles (a new world which Kafka never actually set foot in). To me it felt that Kafka's main inspiration was The Adventure of Pinocchio...could it be?
Amerika,3,"September 19, 2021","Most reviewers take this to be a light read, and I agree; perhaps too light for my taste, despite glimpses of Kafkaesque in the style of unending adventure and painstaking reflection."
Amerika,5,"May 6, 2022","Definitely kafkaesque that’s for sure, reminded me of Lois lowry’s “the giver”"
Amerika,4,"September 18, 2024","Den var inte särskilt kafkaesque denna bok, men språket är kvar, och det hade inte varit kafka om det inte blev sporadiskt och osammanhängande delar i slutet, nästan som om att Brod har tappat bort några delar ur manuskriptet🤫"
Amerika,5,"May 18, 2025","this didn’t feel quite as kafkaesque as you‘d expect from a kafka book – ‘amerika’ is more realistic, humorous even. of course there’s still a quiet unease underneath, but it feels lighter, maybe even a little bit optimistic in comparison to his other works. it’s a strange picture of america that kafka created here – as he‘s never been there, it‘s imagined from afar and feels oddly familiar and unfamiliar at once."
Amerika,3,"May 9, 2007","Up until now I’d been familiar with Kafka as a concept. The term “Kafkaesque” appears in dictionaries as meaning dreamlike and surreal. Although I’d seen a stage adaptation of Metamorphosis, Amerika is the first of his works I’ve read. And it’s often critiqued as the worst…so maybe this wasn’t the best starting place."
Amerika,4,"June 30, 2012","The book has a slow start, possibly due to the fact that it is unfinished and therefore largely unedited by the author. By the second half it is so nearly a masterpiece that it’s almost painful to consider what it might have been had he had the opportunity to finish it and condense it down more succinct version. As uncomfortable as it feels criticising a man who didn’t get to complete his work, it would be fair to say that for a while the middle section drags. Still, once it gets into full swing it’s more than worth every second of its slow start, becoming rich and exciting - and full of those delicious traps misunderstandings and plot circles that we’ve come to know as ‘Kafkaesque’."
Amerika,3,"October 2, 2010","Kafka said that he really liked Charles Dickens, and ""Amerika"" shows this off more than any of his other stories. It seems as though it has the standard Dickens formula--youthful hero, outcast, ""orphaned"" or uncaring parents, sent to a new place to make his way--the Bildungsroman if you will. But of course, it's Kafka, and so this story is somewhat a Dickens' doppleganger as his hero goes on an un-Bildungsroman. You also get to see America through a Kafkaesque lens, and he's either a symbolic genius or just really didn't understand his secondary sources; for instance, the Statue of Liberty holds a sword."
Amerika,3,"March 17, 2010","Have you ever seen that off-beat weird ass movie ""Nothing but Trouble"" starring Chevy Chase, Dan Akroyd and Demi Moore? This book reminds me a lot of that movie. It is a funny book, but more like creepy weird funny. I'd hate to say Kafkaesque funny, but it works so well. This book was written before The Trial and The Castle which were the companion novels and like those books this one was never finished, but it seems way more resolved than The Castle and a little less resolved than The Trial. This one by far is the lightest one but it still has its oppressive moments and they sneak up on you a lot more easily than those in his other stories. While bouncing around in a fantastical America, Karl gets into all sorts of trouble and is mostly accosted by outside forces, hence the oppressiveness. The ending is far better and joyful than any of his other novels though. I would recommend starting on this book if you want to get into Kafka, if you start on The Castle you will more than likely hate Kafka, The Trial is my favorite, but this one is a lot more approachable."
Amerika,5,"June 27, 2021","A sixteen years old Karl Rossmann is forcibly sent to ""Amerika"" to the city of ""New York"" by his parents to find a good job after he's caught in a scandal with his housemaid who seduced him for having the coitus. Karl reaches penniless to New York City by ship and noticed the statue of liberty which has a sword in her hand instead of the torch which reflects the surrealism of the world Kafkaesque. He forgets his umbrella somewhere, and now he can't find it. He meets an already suffered stoker who works in the ship's engine room and he inquiries about his lost umbrella. The stoker who was kicked off of the job by his superiors leads Karl in the office for the sake of defense for his lost job. In the room, Karl advocates the stoker in a surreal way having no authority for fighting in the stoker's defense. In the meantime, a wealthy man (Jacob) gets Karl's attention and declares or pretends to be his uncle. He then detaches his nephew from the matter of the stoker and they go to his house. Uncle jacob provides many facilities to Karl and also in a sort he imprisons him in the house, not giving him the freedom to leave the house without his permission."
Amerika,3,"February 25, 2018","Sadly, for Kafka, he has come to be identified with the Kafkaesque. So, 'America' comes across as to the reader as being very different from 'The Trial' and 'The Castle' as its protagonist never really gives up on hoping for what might be a better tomorrow."
Amerika,3,"June 5, 2014","This is where the narrative break occurs, and we next meet up with Karl as he discovers a placard posted by the Oklahoma Theatre, promising gainful employment to anyone (that word ""anyone"" is important to Karl at this point in the novel) who wants it. So Karl goes to the appointed place, where some elements of the familiar Kafkaesque bureaucracy creep in--only to recede quickly enough, and Karl is assigned the job of ""technical worker."" Then Karl and the few other recruits are rushed off to the train station, where they are placed on a train to Oklahoma. On the train, Karl meets up with his friend Giacomo from the hotel, who has also joined the Theatre. And this is where the book ends."
Amerika,2,"May 6, 2018","In the beginning, I wanted to make sense of the whole thing. I wanted to see logic in it. I hoped really hard that someone or something would knock some sense in the characters that Karl Rossmann encounters along the way. But no, everyone is absurd. Everyone is bizarre and has a loose screw. Everyone just doesn't make sense. And whatever hope you have in the beginning is extinguished, little by little, that the only thing left is to wish for death, as that probably is the best escape one can hope for in such a Kafkaesque situation."
Amerika,3,"November 27, 2017","This was an interesting book. I was hooked from the start. From the beginning, I was attached to the protagonist and cared for his general well being. This is a symptom expirenced by readers brought on by superb authorship. This book deals with the adventures of a German immigrant, Karl Rossman, after arriving to New York. The synopsis of it is basically that he was exiled to America by his parents after his rapist (who was the family housekeeper) was impregnated by him. Already a very bizarre and kafkaesque beginning. The whole book deals with his ordeal in America and his pursuit in finding a decent occupation that will financially sustain him in the new foreign land he’s in. Although the era of the setting is never said outright, I get the impression that it’s post-Great Depression. I don’t want to write much about the plot for fear of spoiling it. What I will say is that throughout the book, Karl confronts surreal and baffling circumstances that one can generally credit to consistent and stubborn bad luck."
Amerika,4,"September 25, 2017","Kafka's ""Amerika"" (AKA The Man Who Disappeared) is the first of his three novels. It was written around 1910-14 but published posthumously in 1927. Kafka never completed the novel; he stopped at chapter 6 but then added what is now thought to be the last chapter. Kafka hinted to his friend and biographer Max Brod that he intended to give this book a happy ending. ""Amerika"" is about a young boy whose parents send him from Prague to New York to avoid a scandal. In the available 6 chapters, we learn of his adventures to find a job in a ruthless New York city. ""Amerika"" has a less kafkaesque and nightmarish nature than any of Kafka's books. Some of the episodes are more surreal with elements of comedy. Kafka himself never visited the US but the book was inspired by his relatives who emigrated to the United States. Kafka also was influenced by reading of travel books and of Dickens novels. In one of his diary he wrote ""My intention was, as I now see, to write a Dickens novel, enriched by the sharper lights which I took from our modern times, and by the pallid ones I would have found in my own interior."""
Amerika,3,"May 5, 2024","Bueno, a decir verdad fue una experiencia diferente. Las pocas veces que me (acosté) a leer el libro me engaché a el por al menos una hora, pero a la vez ha sido uno de los libros con los que más se me ha dificultado el iniciar la actividad de leer. En parte creo que se debe a lo ""pesada"" que es la narración en esta historia a partir de cierto punto. Desde el inicio hasta justo antes de ser contratado en el hotel, considero que la novela mantiene esa esencia de Kafuka (al menos de la trilogía? de novelas) en la que cada capítulo está sólo ligeramente ligado al que sigue, donde los personajes dejan su marca pero pueden perfectamente no volver a aparecer. De hecho, creo que tienen una narración mucho más llevadera que las otras dos hasta ese punto. A partir de ahí, sin embargo, empieza a tener una narración que considero más lenta, descriptiva y ""uneventful"" (poco remarcable en español? no encuentro traducción apropiada) que también plagó una parte del Castillo, asumo que porque no hubo editor o editorial que condensara la narración. En fin, personajes más memorables que los de las otras novelas (las cuales son más surreales a decir verdad), un estilo algo más tradicional que kafkaesque y una primera mitsd bastante buena, que se ve perjudicada por una segunda mitad más lenta y pesada, pero que no por ello es realmente aburrida una vez se está inmerso. Eso sí, como concepto o en cuanto a dejarme impresionado, siento que las otras dos novelas tratan de y ejecutan temáticas más interesantes y memorables, en los que aún pienso esporádicamente."
Amerika,4,"August 26, 2019","The final chapter is pretty confusing, and it's a real shame the book is incomplete. Kafka is at his most normal here in Amerika. The dialogue can often feel feverish (an effect I assume is intentional) and scenes often feel chaotic or claustrophobic or both, with lots of moving around confusing buildings, people touching the protagonist, many speakers crammed into offices or dining rooms or balconies, and events taken sudden turns that provide sufficient disorientation for characters and readers. None of the twisted, impossible logic we know as the Kafkaesque is really present, and with another chapter or two and some edits, this could pass as a novel written by a normal person."
Amerika,2,"March 22, 2020","This novel, unfortunately, just isn't Kafkaesque enough."
Amerika,4,"August 24, 2020","So Amerika but not America, Kafka and Karl but not K, and more hope than the usual Kafkaesque utter despair."
Amerika,2,"August 19, 2018","Two kafkaesque elements make their presence felt in Amerika, thankfully: quirky characters and an almost cringe-like (in the good sense) sort of randomness. However, these do not excel as they do in his other works mostly because of the context- here they can be merely taken at face value, without potential for abstractisation or drawing parallels. The only exception was the Nature Theatre of Oklahoma chapter, Kafka through and through in its delicious absurdity and meaning, which felt out of place here in more ways than one."
Amerika,4,"December 5, 2021","Amerika is by far the easiest, gaiest and easy-going book by Kafka, like much of his other works it is taking place in early 20th century ""West"" where the protagonist (Karl Rossmann) encounters one absurd event after the other, with American bureaucracy, skepticism in foreigners, and much more. As I said, the last chapter stands kind of alone, and it ends out of nowhere without a satisfying conclusion to Rossmann's life but since much of Amerika has been loosely inter-woven stories with Rossmann as the guiding thread the story doesn't suffer too much from its sudden abruption. Rather it adds to the ""Kafkaesque"" atmosphere."
Amerika,3,"June 13, 2022","This is probably the least Kafkaesque work by Kafka, though the story having a good premise, still is mediocre because of it was unfinished."
Amerika,Not rated,"February 14, 2023","Having started a few novels you might call ""kafkaesque""* I thought I'd write down some thoughts about the first time I encountered Kafka:"
Amerika,3,"October 9, 2023","This was my least favorite Kafka novel. Albeit, depictions of America were descriptive, glorified segments placed together to create an imaginary whole, much like the artist Bierstadt who blended scenes to create glorified yet sometimes imaginary landscapes (incredibly so and I do admire them), but the harsh realities of the American setting at that time are overlooked. Instead, the reader experiences a harsh America through the protagonist’s poor choices. Karl Rossman, the main character, is seduced by his female servant and she becomes pregnant. Karl’s family ships the teenager off to America! What a solution. There are comical art sketches throughout the book displaying some of the strange scenes of Karl’s adventures. Karl’s odd relationships with women and his naivety become annoying to me. Why does he return to the scandalous thieves, Robinson and Delemarche (an Irishman and a Frenchman). He is the fool cheated in the new America by those who really are fulfilling their “American dream”. Yes, there are comical elements and witty Kafkaesque style, but I found myself annoyed by Karl’s inhibition and lack of discernment and struggling to finish reading the novel."
Amerika,3,"January 19, 2024","After reading The Castle, The Trial and Metamorphosis this book became easier to read. The amount of Kafkaesque landscape is just about the right amount for a simple reader like myself. I found it enjoyable having already grown used to Kafka's style, and at the same time this is much easier to read than his other books. The Castle for example was very difficult to read as being a reader I could not but felt as frustrated as the main protagonist in the novel and it was difficult to keep going."
Amerika,5,"February 2, 2025","Về một chàng thanh niên 16 tuổi Karl Rossmann bị bố mẹ đẩy sang Mỹ sau khi cố ý (trong mắt mọi người), hoặc bị ép buộc (nếu lời kể của cậu chàng là sự thật) khiến một cô hầu mang thai, rồi từ ấy gặp liên tiếp những người và sống vô số sự kiện mà nhìn chung là bi hài. Mặc dù được đánh giá là một tác phẩm ‘un-Kafkaesque’ nhất trong bộ ba Vụ án - Lâu đài - Nước Mỹ, trên trang giấy mình gặp vẫn là Kafka, vẫn những câu văn dài ngoằng, vẫn cái ngột ngạt và bức bối thường trực - tuy các sự kiện chóng vánh đến mức có đôi phần hài hước. Vẫn có ở mình cảm tưởng như đang sống giữa bốn bức tường kính quan sát nhân vật lên voi xuống chó với giấc mơ Mỹ mà không thể nhảy vào bảo Karl sống bớt thật thà đi. Và tin được không, Kafka đã vẽ thành hình thành khối một nước Mỹ thế kỷ 19 dù chưa từng đặt chân lên miền đất hứa này. Chỉ có điều Nữ thần Tự do cầm kiếm, trở thành Nữ thần Công lý chĩa thẳng vào Karl, và tìm đâu ra trên bản đồ nước Mỹ một bang tên Oklahama? Chắc bởi vậy mà tên gốc cuốn sách là Amerika, đất nước hình thành trong bộ não của tác giả - chứ không phải America mà ai cũng hay."
Amerika,5,"February 16, 2020","Powerful and unsettling. Kafka's ability to create a tone that is wholly his own from the very first page and pervades through every scene is mesmerizing. Through his almost surreal sequencing of events the novel explores issues psychological and familial with equal force as it does the societal/social. The sense of strangeness that he brings to everyday phenomena is exactly what people talk about when they discuss de-familiarization. Guilt, judgment, being watched, bureaucracy, crowds, cityscapes, work culture, feeling out of place, interrogated -- all jump out with a unique feel that can only be described as Kafkaesque. The ending fragmentation is hard to know what to deal with, and I think the book rejects any totalizing interpretation, but there is plenty here worthy of more thought and discussion. Very interesting reading this at the same time as Discipline and Punish, both make institutions of everyday life appear anew, each in their own manner."
Amerika,4,"November 20, 2019","I am big fan of Kafa like everyone. His art of writing is so unique and beautiful that i feel pity we have so less of his work available. Unlike most of his work directed on bureaucracy and typical Kafka kafkaesque, this book brings a new Kafka who is comic too. The story revolves around a German guy Carl, trying to make both ends meet as an immigrant to Great America. Numerous challenges he faces, different kind of characters he meets adding some funny moments and his will power to make big attracts you to his story. There were several instances when i laughed alone in my room while reading Carl's adventures :)"
Amerika,4,"September 4, 2023","This was another Kafkaesque book that I've grown accustomed to at this point with the characters doing things that don't always line up with how I think things are going and circumstances that seem inescapable. He creates that uncomfortable tug and pull that makes you desire the character to make X decision vs. Y and being disappointed when that decision isn't the one made. The plot was fairly easy to follow and an entertaining quick read. I'm glad to have included this one into my Kafka collection since it was his first of three full length stories however unfinished they may have been. I'm not quite sure what draws me to him, but there's something about his character and work that makes me want to understand him and why he wrote what he did."
Amerika,5,"July 1, 2025","Definitely my favourite writing of Kafka (as well as probably the easiest to comprehend). Perhaps not as 'kafkaesque' as his other works, but of course still absurd in its own way."
Amerika,3,"June 8, 2024","To be painfully honest, this novel, compared to other Kafka works I’ve read, seems to be the one in the earliest stages of the development. “The Trial” seemed to have a more thorough, complete understanding of the world the story took place, the characters, the ideological labyrinth that underlies the whole story in a kind of metaphor; “Amerika” had bright flashes of these Kafkaesque elements, but in other areas the story tended to drag and really even lacked much substance at moments. However, this is a much more unconventional story structure than is typical for Kafka in my estimation, so it was certainly interesting to see his take on the road novel and/or coming-of-age story."
Amerika,3,"November 1, 2024","I would say the absurd farce of much of this was enjoyable, though it got to be a bit overbearing at times: it feels much more Rowan Atkinson than Monty Python. But, it was published in raw form, posthumously and incomplete, sans editing, and there are clearly large portions missing near the end. I am glad I read it, though I am not sure I would have finished it if it was not a book club pick. It did, however, foster lively discussion, and rarely have I seen a book so fiercely reviled and defended in a single group! Overall, I am still struggling with how I actually feel about this least Kafkaesque of Kafka works."
Amerika,3,"February 22, 2018","Karya Kafka yang lebih picaresque ketimbang kafkaesque. Novel Kafka paling ceria. Kafka sendiri paling jauh pergi cuma sebatas Prancis dan Italia, namun inspirasi Kafka tetap dapat ditarik dari hubungan peliknya dengan ayahnya. Tentang seorang cowok berusia 16 yang diusir ayahnya, berkat rayuan pembantunya, dan dikirim ke Amerika. Cowok itu, Karl Rossman, luntang-lantung di New York, dan berakhir berganti nama jadi Negro. Meski seperti kebanyakan kisah Kafka: kisah ini pun enggak rampung."
Amerika,4,"May 20, 2024",really enjoyed this one! saw a lot of people say this is one of kafkas lighter works which i understand based on other stories ive read by him but tbh 90% of this book freaked me out. the chapters ‘a country house near new york’ and ‘a refuge’ especially showcased kafkas brilliant writing and genuinely made me feel claustrophobic. parts of this book kept reminding me of a series of unfortunate events which got me thinking omg lemony snicket is so kafkaesque
Amerika,4,"June 21, 2017","Tam olarak bitmeyen ve boşlukları olan bir kitabı okumak da güzel olabiliyormuş, tamam ama bu yoruculuğu napıcaz Kafka dayı, zaten ekran başında kötü adama saydıran teyze gibi sinir bozan tipleri koydun çocuğun karşısına bi de hala yok yola tüküren dede, yok camdan sarkan velet, bu mu Amerika? (: baya başarılı, kafkaesque baymıosa okunmalı/"
Amerika,5,"August 19, 2023","My favorite book of Kafkas. It was quite entertaining and Karla journey to find a job that was suitable for him in america portrays the meaningless theme that Kafka describes as Kafkaesque. He meets with various characters along his journey with unfavorable characteristic qualities, duping, manipulating, him in an effort to abuse his youth."
Amerika,3,"March 13, 2024","A Kafka adventure book, missing the “Kafka magic” we see in other stories, for an example: when one turns into a bug. Not as intereasting, nevertheless crucial for understanding “Kafkaesque”. Once you know the writing process and the story behind this novel, it becomes dear to you, regardless of the seemingly simple-minded story. Thank you Max Brod, thank you Kafka."
Amerika,3,"April 18, 2024","feels criminal to give any kafka novel less than 4 stars so know this was a very solid 3.5 and i thought it was excellent in its bizarre and darkly comic kafkaesque way and i’ll probably have more fun thinking about it than i had reading it, but i was not as compelled as i am by some of his other writings"
Amerika,4,"January 5, 2019","Started off thinking this wasn't very Kafkaesque based on the short stories I read 15 years ago and the everyday use of the term. However, it gradually dawned on me that this is Kafkaesque, but its whimsicality had put me off the scent. This is happy Kafka."
Amerika,5,"March 22, 2023","The companion piece to Daniel Clowes, ""Like A Velvet Glove Cast in Iron"", a look at the perversity of America. A vision of America so bleak it could only be described as ""Kafkaesque""."
Amerika,5,"May 13, 2023","All of the malice and absurdity, the Stockholm syndrome, the political disinterest, and the velocity of immigrant life without the Kafkaesque beurocracy."
Amerika,4,"November 6, 2023","Hard to describe what makes something Kafkaesque. A huge part of it seems to be the overreaction to the mundane, and the underreaction to the extreme. Very interesting and a little unsettling."
Amerika,4,"March 8, 2024",Kafkaesque
Amerika,5,"October 17, 2024",Kafkaesque but a bit more humorous than usual! I wish he finished this one.
Amerika,3,"April 15, 2025",Where is the kafkaesque 3
Amerika,4,"April 21, 2025","I was managed to be fooled twice into thinking that there was going to be a happy ending for this one, but that wouldn’t be very Kafkaesque now would it?"
Amerika,3,"August 15, 2021","The least kafkaesque work if Kafka, enjoyable at some points and tedious at others."
Amerika,4,"March 13, 2022","Incredible -- Kafka's vision of his hero in America is real yet skewed, skewed perhaps closer to the truth than anything 'real' ever is. Karl, ever so serious and formal, is acted on again and again by truly outrageous happenstance. This is it -- the land of opportunity with its hustle and bustle and freedom, but in the foreground the same immutable form of societal machinery clinks and whines and whirs and spins out the same inevitable insensible yarn for our hero, and this time around it's hard not to laugh. I'm thinking of those rascally elevator boys, the disgusting magnetic Brunelda, Karl's furrowed brow and immaculate etiquette . . . and yet the rug is pulled, and pulled, or Karl himself jumps ship in a manner of speaking . . . but at points there is nothing funny at all, the gravity of Karl's outrageous misfortune weighs the hopeful observer down so, such as the fateful, brutal, blindsiding decision of Karl's uncle, or the heavy, malicious hand of the head porter, a man full of senseless hatred for a boy he doesn't know, as he drags Karl toward what threatened to reach a horrible head of abuse . . . what imagery -- what genius! It is Kafka at his most unleashed and eclectic, though there is something in that eclecticism, the this and that and now this, that drops The Missing Person below The Castle on my all-time list of Kafka favourites. The Castle just struck me so. There is a singular potency in The Castle. But The Missing Person, or as Brod calls it and as we know it, Amerika, is essential in its own right: the hopeless and Kafkaesque fuse with a sense of humour and optimism not present in Kafka's other works. And as the final chapter bristles with as much devilish uncertainty as utopian insistence, the reader is left on typically shaky ground, feeling in the dark or blinded by the light, reaching and wishing for some sign of the author's intentions, his true conclusion, the total vision. And yet every fragment Kafka wrote is complete in its own right."
Amerika,5,"September 7, 2016","Just as Karl, coming last, quietly took his seat several of them were rising with upraised glasses, and one of them toasted the leader of the tenth recruiting squad, whom he called the “father of all the unemployed.” Someone then remarked that the leader could be seen from here, and actually the umpire's platform with the two gentlemen on it was visible at no very great distance. Now they were all raising their glasses in that direction, Karl too seized the glass standing in front of him, but loudly as they shouted and hard as they tried to draw attention to themselves, there was no sign on the umpire's platform that the ovation had been observed or at least that there was any wish to observe it. The leader lounged in his corner as before, and the other gentleman stood beside him, resting his chin on his hand.
  - p. 293
The ‘k’ in Amerika stands for “Franz Kafka,” pretty cool, huh! Because this guy IS the letter K! (The letter K is way Kafkaesque: consider how it splits on the right side, dividing a man's isolation into—you got it—equal parts guilt and paranoia!)"
Amerika,4,"November 26, 2016","I started reading Kafka's novel on November 8, 2016, when it seemed that America itself was about to undergo a Kafkaesque nightmare. Strangely - and take no moral from this, America - the novel ""Amerika"" itself surprisingly diverges from what is known as Kafkaesque, that is to say, a nightmare of bureaucracy, small, nameless men crushed beneath the machinery of an indifferent administration that extends into the cosmos, a universe of closing doors. Despite his Statue of Liberty famously holding aloft a gleaming sword instead of a shining lantern, Kafka's Amerika reveals itself in the main to be a countryside of immigrant opportunity; his hero, Karl Rossman, moves from ship to skyscraper to manor house to hotel to the Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, encountering Irishmen (whom he distrusts because he's been told to be wary of the Irish), German maids, Italian elevator boys, and the like, all working hard as he does in the pursuit of making something of themselves. None of the hopelessness and determinism that characterizes the fabulistic Kafka obtains in ""Amerika"": Rossman is an obdurate, if callow, youth, and his country America simply grows and grows."
Amerika,5,"October 11, 2024","Kafka does many things of brilliancy here, and rarely in the history of literature has an author managed to convey such a sense of loss and confusion. Furthermore, the fourth chapter (where Karl meets Delamarche and Robinson and arrives at the Hotel Occidental) is possibly the most ""kafkaesque"" thing Kafka ever wrote along with the third chapter of The Trial, but here he achieves it through comedy rather than dread."
Amerika,3,"January 12, 2017","I love Kafka -- especially the Trial and the short stories -- but this was hard to get into. A young European named Karl Rossmann is sent to America. He has one crazy encounter after another. Call them surreal, call them Kafkaesque. The blurb on the back of the Schocken edition calls it ""Kafka's first and funniest novel."" I didn't find it funny exactly. Some of the scenes where Karl is in trouble with authority figures were kind of disturbing -- not exactly in the way the Trial is, but just bizarre. The whole thing reminded me of a bad dream."
Amerika,3,"September 9, 2016","This novel, with the original title ""The Man who Disappeared"", later published as ""Amerika"", is the least read and the least Kafkaesque of all the novels written by Kafka. The novel was full of ""many shallows, in amongst obviously inaccessible depths""."
Amerika,1,"September 25, 2024","I should give credit where credits due. Kafka did an incredible job capturing the “American experience”(despite never actually having experienced it for himself) yet I cannot honestly say that I enjoyed this book. Though it wasn’t “Kafkaesque,” with a surreal, strange atmosphere, it’s identifiable as one of Kafka’s works through little quirks, one being the organization of the chapters. Each chapter is like a separate subplot, unrelated (for the most part) with the previous one, and though that read perfectly in The Trial, it just made me lose my mind in Amerika. My favorite part was the introduction, not even part of the book, or by Kafka, which says a lot… I wanted to get into it, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t delude myself into believing that reading this wasn’t exhausting… It’s not necessarily that the writing was bad, it’s just that it wasn’t engaging in the slightest."
Amerika,4,"November 21, 2013","Kafka's first novel (which he left unfinished) is his least Kafkaesque, almost seeming lighthearted in comparison to his other works. Whilst being less neurotic it paves the way for him to indulge in the relationship of powerful figures of authority over the subservient, impotent, victimized, whelp. In his later works this relationship can become almost stiflingly oppressive, but Amerika is written with a comedic irony to it, which at times reminded me of 'A Confederacy of Dunces' in its use of comedy, tragedy and farce."
Amerika,3,"December 14, 2016","This is a strange one. Not yet very Kafkaesque, but rather surreal, like the dreams I sometimes have, tumbling from one scene into another."
Amerika,4,"September 26, 2008","I spent a while reading this book, not because it was a difficult read but because I chose a very stressful time to read it. Consequently, it was kind of my sidekick for the past few weeks. I'm gutted that I don't know German, cause I bet this book is ten times better in its orginal text, but I still enjoyed it tons. The only thing is that it didn't really end. So I feel very strange now, having finished it only a few minutes ago. The whole story is charming, funny, nerve-wrecking, and *wait, what?* all at once. I want to write something Kafkaesque for my next writing project, definetely."
Amerika,3,"May 30, 2013","As an immigrant to America myself, I connect with the trials and tribulations of Karl Rossman. The unsettledness, the urgency to find a foothold, the flashes of memories back home- good and bad, a sense of constant movement are very much a given for any immigrant. This struggle is well captured by Kafka. This book is very different from his other books. Notwithstanding the absence of Kafkaesque moments, the story made for a great read. It’s hard to imagine what prompted Kafka to write such a story given he spent most of his lifetime in one country."
Amerika,3,"November 1, 2014","Unlike his other works that espouse melancholy such as the left did with causes of equality, this one is a lighter read and somehow less kafkaesque in my opinion. Young Karl banished to America by his parents for having been in an affair with the maid, is faced with the task of surviving in a land unknown yet brimming with opportunities. His aimless journey through this land gives us a sense of how kafka himself may have lived. It would be unfair to compare this to trial or castle as it feels like an experiment left unfinished with less than half the absurdity that should have existed."
Amerika,3,"December 11, 2007","Reading up on this after finishing it, people keep writing that it's his most lighthearted and least Kafkaesque novel. If this is true then colour me extra-scared of reading anything else by him. There was plenty I found pretty nightmarish in this - namely all the awful, uncontrollable situations he keeps finding himself in, and the way everybody he encounters in the book seems to behave in a strangely threatening and unpredictable way. Much like people you meet in... nightmares."
Amerika,4,"December 3, 2020",Karl is a 15 year old kid from Germany who his sent off to America after having relations with a 35 year old servant who seduced him into having seduced him into having sex with her. This read was the true embodiment of kafkaesque with the main character Karl struggling against mankind and the world throughout the novel. Every time something seems to go right for him everything else seems to go wrong.
Amerika,3,"May 2, 2012",Very Kafkaesque.
Amerika,3,"December 28, 2012",Kafkaesque.
Amerika,4,"December 7, 2013",Fantastically Kafkaesque and tragically unfinished. Brilliant nevertheless.
Amerika,3,"November 20, 2017","My prediction [ or rather hope] is that the missing chapter betwenn the last and second last, feature a scene where Karl suffocates Delamarche's with his own intestinal organs, and then sets ablaze to the Head Porter's office. Actually I'm sounding like i'm wanting a Kafkaesque Rambo. Yes, the answer is yes I do."
Auto da F ,4,"July 6, 2020","The literal translation of the German title of Auto da Fe is The Blinding, or perhaps more idiomatically, The Deception. The question this latter raises is: Who is deceiving whom? The unrelenting comic irony suggests that everyone is deceiving not only everyone else, but also themselves. All the characters are mad to some degree, and Kafkaesque to the extent that they emerge out of a somewhat hostile, vaguely Eastern European world in which they are striving to survive but about which they have little understanding. Each pursues his chosen 'ism' - idealism, materialism, hedonism, aspirationalism - with relentless determination and in determined secrecy since none are comprehensible to the others."
Auto da F ,4,"March 28, 2013","In his Nobel prize speech Canetti named Kraus, Kafka, Musil and Broch as his main inspirations. I can't say anything about the other three and their influence on this book but it definitely is kafkaesque."
Auto da F ,5,"July 19, 2017","The plot goes in a shadowy world and it reminds of Kafkaesque motifs which Canetti himself has also confessed that ""insect"" writer's influence. Because of Canetti's writing style the characters' situations are given in a bunch of long sentences that demand too much attention from reader. Three main headlines of this novel call for a more complicated review than mine: the head without a world; the world without a head; the world in the head..."
Auto da F ,3,"April 27, 2013","Kafkaesque, sardonic and occasionally really funny. But disturbing as well."
Auto da F ,4,"July 7, 2021","As a result, the narration, shifting between different character's perspectives, between absurd misreadings of each other, between manic fantasies of the future and hard present realities, becomes tangled. I found myself at times floundering for comprehension as much as one of his characters. The novel has been described as Kafkaesque but I was reminded much more of Hesse's Steppenwolf, with its characters existing in solitude, in multiple worlds, with multiple personalities."
Auto da F ,2,"January 21, 2023","Stopped at the beginning of part II. I’m not sure Canetti needed 600 pages to prove a Kafkaesque theme (autocorrect changed theme to Therese, the irony) of man amidst the modern world — greed, corruption, and in many ways exile. Neither man’s will nor intellect can solely save him, as the overcompensation of one leads to his own demise."
Auto da F ,3,"April 26, 2025","The story begins to get totally Kafkaesque around ""The Thief""/""Private Property"" chapters, to a point where it is overly ridiculous at times, but also entertaining, in a grim way. Some chapters get hallucinatory to the point of incomprehensible, such as ""Trousers"". Fischerle is an over-the-top caricature of Jewish stereotypes. Couldn't take him seriously as a human being; seemed like something the Nazis would have created in a propaganda pamphlet."
Auto da F ,3,"August 18, 2015","I don't think I've ever read a book quite like Auto-da-Fé before. After finishing it, I read several reviews suggesting that the tone is Kafkaesque, and I definitely see it."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"October 20, 2022","This is a kafkaesque story of an entomologist who travels to a remote village in search of a new species of beetle. It is he and not the bug who is captured. The village is beset by relentless sand. Their homes have already been buried so deep that it takes full time effort by residents to remove incoming sand from the holes in which their houses are now nearly buried to keep from being destroyed. Jumpei is placed in the home of a widow to help her. The story tells of his imprisonment and his attempts to escape. There is much detail here about sand, but the true intent here is an examination of life. What is existence? What is the true role of man? Do we control our fate? If so, how much? A bond grows between the man and woman, and becomes sexual. Finally, he is faced with a choice, when freedom is offered, to stay or go. There is one scene that is quite chilling, in which taunting village elders at the top of his hole tease him that they will set him free if he will only have sex with the woman in their view. God playing with his human toys? I appreciated the intellectual drive of the novel, but I never felt much of a visceral tie to the characters. The absurdity of the story prevented that for me."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"June 5, 2018",When we mix surrealistic Kafkaesque climate with existential questions about sense of human being then we get something like  The woman in the dunes.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"November 23, 2024","Having read a few pages of Abe's Box Man a long time ago and found them painfully dull, I was a little worried about reading this. But the first half of the book absolutely had me gripped. I was turning pages rapidly, fascinated by the man's dilemma, trying to work out if he was indeed being held against his will, or if there was just some huge misunderstanding that had not yet been revealed. I'm tempted to describe the book as&nbsp;Kafkaesque but that probably isn't accurate since Kafka dealt with the oppressive weight of bureaucracy (even in Metamorphosis, his change into an insect is not as important as how he will explain it to his employers, support the family, etc). I also don't think it's an accident that the main character here is interested in insects. But this book is more allegorical in nature, the themes focusing on the relentless struggle of existence, the inability of ever escaping the daily drudge of work and sexual instinct, the constant search for a literal way out. The book is saturated in oppressive heat, constant sand, and lack of water. I could almost taste it at times, the gritty texture in my mouth, until I had to swallow some saliva and clear my throat. The book is just relentless.&nbsp;"
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"March 30, 2017","The Woman in the Dunes is an important novel of the 20th century which, through its eerie atmosphere and Kafkaesque story, raises a few timeless questions on modern society. I recommend it to pretty much everyone."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"November 26, 2019","The ending of this book lingered with me for a couple of days after finishing it. I picked up The Woman in the Dunes expecting to find an eerie story... And eerie was what I got, except it was eerie in the Kafkaesque sense, which I did not expect, and it haunted me with the existential problems that it addressed."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"May 5, 2025",Prachtig. Begint kafkaesque en blijft wringen. Waar blijft de vrouw in het gat zand scheppen… waarom berust zij in haar lot. Wat maakt een leven zinvol? Schitterend geschreven.
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"January 4, 2025","An unsettling, repetitious kafkaesque story about submission into routine that would’ve worked better as a short story, as a movie (which it is, more on that in a moment), and with much less misogyny. The writing is circular and wrapped in indeterminacy — the world see-saws nowhere and has no logical or material place. Descriptions are worthless in that way, the environment is a big Möbius strip of nonsense as are the various tangents and flashbacks the protagonist, Jumpei, has. And on top of all that, he’s the biggest piece of shit vile protagonist I’ve read in a minute. His abuses and assaults happen nearly every other page; and between them, Abe writes the namesake “woman in the dunes” as a faceless and identity-less doll with which Jumpei does as he pleases. It’s gross and dull and gross."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"January 25, 2014","Everyone says Abe is Kafkaesque and there is something in that because of the surreal way which he just drops into dystopian communities and surreal circumstance. His storytelling is effortless, which is remarkable given how surreal the plot is. He never awkwardly stumbles trying to explain it to the reader. And like Kafka, he's a veritable page turner. I was often staying up past my bedtime with this book because I lost track of time."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"July 8, 2024","Abe’s book has been called “kafkaesque”—in perhaps a rare occurrence when the word is used appropriately and deserving of such an adjective. Comparisons to Alfred Kubin are also not unwarranted. Here an entomologist who studies sand flees the city and finds himself trapped in a sand hole, lured like an insect by villagers who send down provisions by ropes and baskets. In the hole is the eponymous “woman”, who has resigned herself to a life of illegal detention, an existence of weaving and shovelling. Strange that a book of 240 pages should take place primarily in a hole in the desert, but what Abe manages to do symbolically with sand, with space, stars, even spiders and saliva, is the work of a profound observer of nature."
The Woman in the Dunes,1,"January 15, 2025","Found the concept really interesting but I didn't really like this book. It should've been a postmodern Japanese Kafkaesque tale, it was a misogynistic story about of a man who is tricked into living in a hole in the dunes. I see a point of helplessness permeating throughout the narratives but honestly it was nihilist and incredibly claustrophobic"
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"December 27, 2023","The kafkaesque climate, the absurdity and eeriness of the plot as well as the role of the woman makes this a very intriguing story, a real page-turner. In the end this is an existential - marxist novel."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"August 3, 2024",Quick read. Very Kafkaesque. I was hoping for more discussion about desert bugs and the physics of sand. I’m kind of sick of books about a man who becomes hopelessly obsessed with a woman and loses himself somehow- I’ve read too many books like that lately.
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"January 28, 2024","If books had soundtracks, this one would have a constant faint droning noise. At times I wanted to put this novel down because I didn’t want to keep reading this awful allegorical repetitive defeatist story and it was starting to give me a slight headache. The main character is such an unsympathetic bitch that it’s hard for me to care about his plight, which I guess is the point. The atmosphere is profoundly bizarre and unsettling and perhaps Kafkaesque. It was a decent book that I did not particularly enjoy reading. I would not read it again."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"May 12, 2022","Once again plunged into the dirty, gritty, and twisted Japanese literary mind. A Kafkaesque nightmare where an entomologist finds himself imprisoned against his will by sand-dwelling villagers. Ultimately we realise that the routine (un)pleasantness of a life is appreciated only when it is chosen."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 1, 2025","Aside from the incredibly annoying sand-related spam that I had to get used to, this book places the formidable protagonist, Niki Junpei, in a sort of kafkaesque situation where he becomes trapped by a few villagers who initially sheltered him during his vacation to find new beetle species. This novel illustrates how a person can maintain an ambitious mindset even when their circumstances seem mundane. The evolving meaning of 'hope' throughout the book is masterfully written. I almost gave it a 3 because of the odd pacing and the details that more or less don't elevate the storytelling but the ending made this reach a peak, so bonus points for that. I'm pretty sure a lot of the material in the book flew over my head, so I""ll probably pick it up again when I'm in the mood. :)"
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"January 26, 2025","Lets say he found the bug he was looking for. Existential and kafkaesque, it was an easy read but not so easy to review. Great worldbuilding with the theme of human animalistic nature."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"February 28, 2024","This book is about a man who gets abducted into staying in a hole with a woman. The man is supposed to shovel sand and stay in the hole, but he tries to resist this and escape to his normal life Eventually, he learns to live with it. As you can see, the plot is simple. What makes it work is the diction. The descriptions are beautifully strange, and give a sort of otherworldiness to the characters. Speaking of them, other than the man, the woman is perfectly content with their roles shoveling sand, and provides beautiful contrast to the man's wavering determination to resist. The villagers also work well in their roles as Kafkaesque foils to the main character, and the man's conversations with them are some of the funniest parts of the novel. The book fails, however, in its length. What is an entertaining dynamic turns into a exhausting one over 200 pages, and Kobo Abe could have tried to cut out the fluff, like the 2 chapters on the man's STDs which I couldn't comprehend and seemed jarring. Overall, this is a strange and entertaining book that goes on for far too long."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"September 1, 2022","1) Abe is the Kafka of Japan. The Sisyphean task of perpetually digging sand out of a pit so as to keep the ever collapsing dunes from swallowing your house is very Kafkaesque. Abe was a member of the Japanese Communist Party and sought to organzine laborers in poor parts of Tokyo so as to improve their living conditions. *Spoiler Alert* The man's decision to stay in the dunes, forever filling buckets of sand to protect his new family and furthering his water collecting invention, was perhaps just as rewarding as working a job to support his family back in the city. When workers are removed from the Means of Production, all labor can feel like simply filling buckets with sand so as to support your family."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"December 26, 2024","A young entomologist travels to a remote part of Japan, studying bugs, missing his bus and only intending to stay the night. But the village... the unrelenting force of this novel (which won awards n Japan)... has other ideas. The villagers have no route for easy escape, so Niki stays for a time in the forced company of a young widow. The man, Niki, slowly recognizes and resents his fate. The woman (who is never named) is sketched in this novel, only as she interacts with the man, and other villagers. This Kafkaesque book, originally published back in 1962, is a classic of forced isolation and existential dread. But the metaphors for society, loneliness and forced relationships get to be wearing after a while. (If bugs and sand and soil are not your thing, you might want to give this short novel a rain check). The writing is vivid, I will consider other books by Kobo Abe."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"November 3, 2018","This is in many ways a bleak novel. It is regularly described as Kafkaesque, which I think is a fair description. There is a hopelessness about the central characters's position, but in this case the man is an innocent prisoner of people who are themselves outcasts. The writer has made his protagonist not particularly likeable: he is not brave, he is not pleasant, he is often indecisive, he is not particularly intelligent, his relationship with the woman (she is not named) and with his former lover (known simply as the other woman) is totally self-centred and mechanical. He is not the sort of person you would want to make friends with, he is the geek in the corner of the staffroom. He's a man who likes sticking pins in insects for goodness sake! The irony of it all is that he in turn becomes the insect we are studying."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"October 29, 2019","Very Kafkaesque, with a touch of Misery thrown in. Obviously I couldn't read this novel without thinking of technical solutions to their problems. (Minorly, they could just ride the sand, winching or wedging up each side of the house daily; majorly, they could cut a sea-break around the sand/non-sand interface, better wind-breaks, etc. Look at the model for the encroaching Sahara and how that's being dealt with.) Anyway, something of a Stockholm syndrome love story? Very strange and erotic."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"April 8, 2023","In all seriousness, this could’ve easily been a 5⭐️ read if it weren’t for the horrifying sex scene. The Stockholm Syndrome commentary before Stockholm Syndrome was even discovered is amazing. Abé also somehow executes a Kafkaesque story better than Kafka himself. Literally was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Can’t wait to watch the movie."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"January 15, 2024","This book was given to me by my favorite hs teacher and I've brought it along with me, unread, from my parents' house to 7 different homes over 19 yrs. I'm so happy I finally got to read it. Kafkaesque to its core and, at times, v lonely, this book appealed to my inherent existentialist ideals: there is no master plan, no God, no meaning to anything-but with that comes so much freedom, so much agency to create our own purpose, our own meaning. And that is so fuckin empowering. Highly recommend."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"February 9, 2024","A thrilling, suffocating, and weird psychological novel about two people locked into the Sisyphean task of shoveling sand out of their pit each and every day. It's claustrophobic to a Kafkaesque extent to read about their every action and thought dominated by the sand around them. Quite unlike any novel I've read out of Japan, this work could have easily come out of the cafes of 1950s Paris, and like Camus' similar works this manages to weave existential dread and genuine dread into tight powerful passages. Powerful and unusual read!"
The Woman in the Dunes,Not rated,"April 23, 2023","Faboulous and creepy. Let me sum up the plot in a sentence: dude gets stuck in a hole in the desert, with a woman. Now with that out of the way. This book is a kafkaesque novel, meaning here both thougtprovoking, terrifying, and hilarious. Asking questions like: If you dissappear how long until someone notices? If you are traped with a person and you two enter a relationship, do you fall in love? Can you escape?(no)."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"November 12, 2023","I thought about this book a lot after finishing the reading. It's hard to understand what exactly was the writer's intent. For me it resonated deeply with my relationship with my home country. The woman trying to explain what keeps her in her home even though it's slowly drowning in sand, that weird invisible strings that tie us to a place that is constantly harming us. You know that the struggle is futile and endless, yet you keep waiting and hoping for a day where maybe things will be different. Also the relationship with the village, how they insist 'we must stay here because it's our home, and it's our home because we must stay here', this endless senseless struggle. When Abe wrote it I think he was going for a Kafkaesque nightmare, it's funny that for some this book is actually pretty close to reality."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"April 8, 2022",This is a kafkaesque nightmare.
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"May 9, 2021","I'm not surprised that the first masters of this style of writing were authors with an acute sense for the macabre and disturbing. Any account of the history of dreamlike fiction need to acknowledge the importance of Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft and other literary masters of the horror genre. Even so, Franz Kafka stands out as the seminal figure in exploring the broader possibilities of this approach, creating in works such as The Castle and Trial a tone and ambiance that was less easy to pin down. Yes, an element of horror was palpable, but you could also read these works as political commentaries, existential fables, or some new surreal style of writing that we have learned to call Kafkaesque. His brave exploration of these interstices between the real and unreal made possible the later ascendancy of Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other colonizers of literary dreamland."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"April 18, 2025",very freaky. kafkaesque in both the bug way and the bureaucracy way. the description of the sand is so itchy and vivid that it was impossible to read at the beach. i think my new favorite. also the protagonist is lowk horrible.
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"July 20, 2023","Reading this Japanese classic was long due. I liked the kafkaesque setting and atmosphere. Abe crafts a sense of doom and erotic tension masterfully, but the misogyny and abstruse metaphors left me confused and mentally exhausted at times. It wasn't always clear to me if the misogyny stemmed from the protagonist, the author or if the novel reflected a literary trend. Some expressions like ""spiritual rape"" made my brain give a standing ovation and roll its eyes at the same time. Sand is described in such detail that I could almost dust it off of my hair and scratch it away between my fingers. Recommended—just make sure you'll have a glass of water nearby."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"June 19, 2020","One last note about the claimed kafkaesque feeling of the story. Kafka is one of my favorite writers, if not the most favorite but I can’t say I really enjoyed the writing style of “The woman in the dunes”. I think Kafka is more empathic towards the protagonists of his novels, while Kobo Abe retains a more indifferent, if not judgmental approach. At least in this particular novel. I rarely felt I was treading on the familiar Kafka tracks while reading this book."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"September 6, 2016","Kobo Abe's allegorical novel is surprisingly engaging and at the same time, introspectively frustrating. At the start, an unassuming and seemingly unremarkable young man disembarks from a bus near the sea shore where he hopes to find unusual insects, in pursuit of his hobby of entomology. He soon realizes he must find overnight lodging and allows a stranger to help him. Since no hotels or hostiles are available in the nearby village, the man suggests a small house in the dunes where a woman will take him in as a guest. Ultimately, he finds himself trapped there, in the bottom of a continually eroding sand pit that must be constantly shoveled out to keep the house from collapsing under the sand. Of course, the insect symbolism and the Kafkaesque experience and terror of the unknown, bring the novel Metamorphosis to mind and the unending work to save the house from collapse, is analogous to the Greek fable of Sisyphus, but the truly overwhelming element is the sand. The trapped man becomes obsessed with the physical properties of sand but it appears that here the sand represents life. The sand is relentless and unforgiving. The sand provides life and shelter but at the same time it grinds everything down and finally buries it. The sand fascinates him but any escape from it is futile. The sand is indifferent and ultimately he must learn to accept it... A somewhat depressing but arresting tale by a great writer."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"May 4, 2019","This is a Kafkaesque story of an amateur entomologist who upon visiting a poor village by the sea is, insect-like, trapped in a sand pit along with a nameless woman. They are part of a slave-labor network that protects the village from the encroachment of the sands. After many attempts to escape and going through the stages of death (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance)the story comes to an uncertain end with court documents that announce the man formally missing."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"March 9, 2019","Primarily focusing on the inner monologues of an entomologist named Niki Jumpei, and the volatile relationship between himself and the woman who ""captured"" him, Kōbō Abe crafts a Kafkaesque story with an open-ended conclusion that leaves the reader in an uncomfortable state of uncertainty. The 1964 film adaption by Hiroshi Teshigahara does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the book, creating a chilling depiction of Abe's nightmarish vision."
The Woman in the Dunes,1,"June 9, 2024",What is going on? This is an oneiric masterpiece? A surrealist dreamscape? A postmodern Japanese Kafkaesque tale? This?
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"December 10, 2020",A man is held captive with a woman at the bottom of a vast sand pit in a seaside village. They must clear away sand every day in order to prevent the village being eaten up by the dunes. I can't remember how I found this book; I enjoyed it though. The combination of bizarre situation and detailed descriptions has something almost Kafkaesque to it. He collects insects and now he's trapped like an insect.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"October 19, 2020","The book is a brilliant surrealist-Kafkaesque rendering of the philosophy of the Absurd that Albert Camus talked about in details in his essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" (1942). In the book, an amateur entomologist decided to spent the night in a remote village after he missed the bus home. He is offered a place, where a woman lives, at the bottom of a huge sand pit. When he attempts to leave in the morning, he discovers that he's actually a prisoner held to help shoveling back the advancing sand that threaten the village."
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"July 24, 2023","The beginning of the story is promising. The man asks the woman if her only reason for existence is clearing away the sand, and she says yes. This foreshadows the existential underpinning of the book, and further down is compared with his previous life of banal daily routine - existence without meaning. However, it soon becomes very Kafkaesque and disturbing. The vivid description of the sand and the effect it has on their skin, their throat and every other aspect of their daily lives is described masterfully. I think this was the only part of the book which I throughly enjoyed, as it truly makes the reader feel as if they are trapped there with the characters and cannot get out."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"February 1, 2021","The Woman in the Dunes is a novel I can appreciate, but not like. It is extremely, dare I say, Kafkaesque. I don't say that lightly, since that term tends to be overused. I would bet a lot of money that Abe read Kafka and could cite him as a major inspiration for this book. It is basically The Castle, with a lot more sand."
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"May 28, 2020","It's an odd book. Short. If I had read any Kafka, I'd be tempted to call it Kafkaesque. It did - in a way - remind me of the television series, The Prisoner. But it seems to me to be a story about how we eventually find ways to make ourselves comfortable in our own prisons. It doesn't matter if that prison is your career as a teacher or being forced to clear sand with a strange woman by a bunch of villagers who tricked you into it. You might struggle a bit at the beginning but things will distract you or you'll find ways to justify what you've done. Then, when you're given the chance to escape, you choose not to take it."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"February 11, 2018","One of the most brilliant, surreal books I’ve ever read. Kobo Abe in his Kafkaesque element."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"January 9, 2022","All in all, an extremely thought-provoking novel, with scenes as gut-wrenching and vile as a Lovecraftian or Kafkaesque novel. Definitely a masterpiece by Kōbō Abe."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 22, 2023",A Sisyphean dream in a Kafkaesque world…
The Woman in the Dunes,Not rated,"September 30, 2023","I enjoyed the book, the ending felt slightly cliched but I don't feel comfortable criticising books as of now. Sex is so much more interesting in books than in movies: the warfare and the dynamics of power involved. I would love to see how they made such a critically acclaimed film out of such an introspective and Kafkaesque book."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"November 10, 2024","The Woman in the Dunes was a very existential and a thought-provoking read about a man being imprisoned against his will until he finally comes to terms with it and chooses to stay there. One of the most interesting things in the story was the depiction of sand. It became sort of like a living being, like something with a mind of its own. When I was reading, I could feel the dryness and hotness that the characters experienced daily. The main story was beautifully done and I found it really clever and kafkaesque."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"April 5, 2021",It has that kafkaesque nighmarish quality of bleakness and monotony with a splash of the absurd. A commentary on existence and purpose and the constraints that society puts on us and that we put on ourselves.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"June 8, 2021","I love this novel! I loved the Kafkaesque atmosphere, the mystery, the eroticism and the exploration of a Sisyphean philosophy of life. Basically a guy walks into a village and gets taken hostage cleaning off a sand dune. And then he has to make terms with his new life - a pointless and repetitive shoveling of sand. However, there's this woman with him who fully lives this lifestyle. And he gets to bang her, so there might be reason to stay. I can't help but read this novel as a metaphor about how relationships often drag us into a repetitive and predictable way of life. But then again, maybe this is a better life, more full than the superficial freedom of living in a modern society. That's at least the conclusion of our Sisyphean hero. Great book. Will read again. Will recommend to anyone who liked Kafka and Camus and wants more like it."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"September 6, 2021","I enjoyed this Japenese Kafkaesque tale about a man held captive in a village that revolves around sand; it was strange, surreal and felt slightly suffocating."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"March 6, 2022","This was such a strange book, but I mostly enjoyed how strange it was. Lots and lots of sand, a surprising amount of sandy sex scenes, and, as many people have said in reviews, an incredibly frustrating bureaucratic/Kafkaesque attitude from the sand people. If you like walking on the beach or feeling the sand between your toes, this is not the book for you. As much as the local government is (one of?) the enemy in this book, the sand is the main antagonist, which I find to be really fascinating. Anyway, overall, this was a really weird book, but it was worth the read."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"May 10, 2022","Themes of loneliness and social alienation resonate throughout as well. The protagonist's Kafkaesque predicament reflects his own alienation from society, so his decision by the story's end is organic and fitting. It's a joy to read, even with all the grotesque and revolting descriptions in every page."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"March 10, 2024","I'm really glad I read this one, although it wasn't much like what I really expected! I found the opening few chapters absolutely captivating--the way the village sunk down into the dunes was described was so mysterious and unexpected, and the slow reveal of the situation facing the man and the woman was really engaging. I ultimately enjoyed the book all the way through, although inevitably as some of the mystery fell away, it had my mind churning less. The wry irony, the Kafkaesque absurdity, the analysis of human psychology--all good."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 13, 2020","This book is about sand. It's also about finding life in the harshest of conditions and how it shapes the morals and daily routines of humans. It's also a reflection on the idea of freedom and what it means in our society. Using a play on the idea of Sisyphus' work in a Kafkaesque world, the writer uses the protagonists' scientific mind to explore human concepts and the conflict between life and inanimate objects around us."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 19, 2024","The first book I've read in a while that was actually kafkaesque after claiming to be. This book, like all of Abe's work, tackles larger questions that he explores through the presentation of a simple plot. A bit too simply written at times, but it makes you think about whether to live is simply to distract oneself from existing, or if there is something more. Either way, you're going to feel the need for freedom."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"January 8, 2018","This is an eerie, kafkaesque book ostensibly about a man who randomly is captured and forced to live with a woman who lives in a giant hole in the sand - yup, really. But what makes this particularly interesting is that for me, it's this great metaphor about the inescapability of the lot anyone of us has drawn in life. Weird, but worth the read."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"November 14, 2021",I think this story earns its categorisation as Kafkaesque. Interesting that Kafka's actual works are more universal and so seemingly immediately relevant to today.
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"May 22, 2022","Kafkaesque, French-lit-influenced with a Japanese twist. Weird and compelling. I thought of some other things he could have tried, but I guess that isn't the point."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"June 11, 2024",I love Kobo Abe's info dump writing style. This novel is very Kafkaesque but instead of bureaucracy or search for God it deals with monotony and social expectations in 1960s Japanese society. I can't recommend this enough
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"March 25, 2019",My first clue that I was doomed was a review I read that the story was Kafkaesque. I shouldn't have wasted my time.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"March 17, 2020",Time summarised it well: 'A haunting Kafkaesque nightmare'. I wold just add: psychedelic.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 27, 2021",Not sure if to take this book as a existential crisis or one about acceptance and learning. Kafkaesque most definitely though.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"September 30, 2022","Interesting, depressing, Kafkaesque. How low can low be? How does one know if s/he’s in a cage? And, does this fact affect one’s happiness?"
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"October 2, 2022","Usually I like Kafkaesque books, but I think that I just don’t like Kobo Abe."
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"May 3, 2023","Was prepared to like this, but it didn't do it for me. Only in theory is this 'Kafkaesque.' I found it closer in tone to a semi-magical realism, like low-tier Calvino, to be honest."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"December 20, 2023",Existentialist horror via Kafkaesque allegory.
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"February 5, 2024",I thought I didn't like it and then I did. I see a lot of people referring to it as kafkaesque but it feels like it was his prison that set him free so I'm not sure what to take away from that.
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"April 8, 2024",I’m a sucker for anything described as kafkaesque.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"June 17, 2025","One learns quite a bit about sand by reading this book. Jokes aside, enthrilling Kafkaesque novel."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"March 24, 2017",Strange in all the right ways... Kafkaesque with a scientific twist.
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"April 5, 2025",The story is absolutely brilliant. A Kafkaesque situation. Subtle use of metaphor with the descriptions of insects the protagonist studies and the sand's invasive immutable nature. Could be interpreted in many ways. Looking forward to watching the film adaptation.
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"January 29, 2015","A very claustrophobic novel, kafkaesque with Dostoevsky qualities (pretty psychological) set in a strange enviroment, which is described gradually but superbly. What struck me the most about this book is the way I could gradually start finding more and more beauty in what otherwise seemed like an awful situation for the main character. It doesn't come across as a critic of our awful, cyclical way of life, but rather as a neutral account, trying to find some kind of beauty in the ugliness."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"February 22, 2014","This is in many ways a bleak book. It is regularly described as Kafkaesque, which I think is a fair description. There is a hopelessness about the central character's position, but in this case the man is an innocent prisoner of people who are themselves outcasts.

He in turn becomes the insect we are studying."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"November 7, 2023","I ate this book up like it was really entertaining. I will say I did have some trouble picturing some of what was trying to be described but that came from a lack of experience with landscapes and shit. I thought the book was interesting the whole way through. Looking at the book as a critique on contemporary society I find it possible that the book could represent people higher above others in class that have the power to force people to work for them or else they are submit to dehydration. I think dumbing it down to just that is not fair though as well because many scenes covered themes of freedom throughout the whole book and in the escape scene, hope in either the crow trap or the way he tries to continuously escape, hopelessness throughout the book, fear and raw emotion in the sandpit scene, desire in the first love scene, and unfair and unbelievable treatment at the literal start of the book when he can’t believe that people are actually being treated in such a way, and also accepting it. It also makes me question and wonder about what the significance and structure of human creations such as weeks, or time, like the sand are for. By the end of the book once the man submits to this new way of life, time starts to pass so fast for him. While this could be a choice from the author to just get to the point in the story where it’s believable for her to be pregnant, I give him more credit cause he wrote a fire story to think that it was an actual choice to show that time kind of just passes once he accepts his role. There’s also of course the theme of existentialism when the man starts to wonder roles of people and if they could possibly be so inconsequential as to just shovel sand for others for a living. The woman in the dune was a character I felt really bad for the whole way through, and while we see the man question her ideas by the last sentence he pretty much turns out just like her. Overall really interesting, I did see a lot of similarities making this book kafkaesque which is what I read a lot about before reading it and was one of the reasons I was interested in reading it. Overall it was really good. It was fire tho."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"May 29, 2014","Some reviewers have criticized what they see as a resigned, nihilistic ending to the book, in which the protagonist merely contents himself with a self-imposed prison. I think, however, that Abe's genius here lies in the fact that he allows his narrator to become a Kafkaesque existentialist hero - one who recognizes the world as it is - and, rather than fall victim to despair, crafts meaning and purpose for himself."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"November 29, 2016","Sometimes, it really matters WHEN you read a book. Because, by total coincidence, I had just finished reading ""Dune"" before I started ""The Woman in the Dunes,"" I spend most of the novel really confused --sand everywhere!--but was it because I was on a sci-fi adventure on a desert planet, or imprisoned in a Kafkaesque Japanese seaside village?"
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"September 1, 2020",Excellent. Existential themes presented through a kind of genre novel with Kafkaesque elements. Style is straightforward but not without complexity.
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"May 22, 2023",I am currently reading strange and weird stories and this fits that description well. I wanted this story to be great but I felt it was only ok. The book does many things well. Kobo reminds the reader of the sand constant and it takes on almost as otherworldly presences. It is constantly there one the skin stealing all the moisture and being trapped in the hole really makes it feel claustrophobic. There is an escape scene about halfway through and he really is able to make it feel frantic. It is very Kafkaesque and Sisyphean. Think the reason I rated 3 instead of 4 was because I didn’t really like the main character but maybe I’m not supposed. It is a recommendation if you are looking or something different.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"January 26, 2015","This is a Kafkaesque nightmare in the style of ""Metamorphosis"". An insect collector goes to a strange seashore village in search of beetles. At night he seeks shelter and is given accommodation with a woman whose house is surrounded by large sand cliffs. In the morning he finds the rope ladder he has descended on has been taken away, the villagers wish to keep him trapped like a slave shovelling interminable sand. We learn a lot about the properties of sand, a grain averaging 1/8 mm in thickness. This is one of those books, which will stay in my mind a long time, it is quite a haunting scenario."
The Woman in the Dunes,5,"November 6, 2013","One of the few times, I will use Kafkaesque. (Since, I feel people don't understand what it means.)"
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"December 3, 2014","An anxiety-inducing allegory of Kafkaesque dimensions. Not only does it bear a resemblance to ""The Trial"" but also pre-figures (inspired?) Paul Auster's ""The Music of Chance"". A relentless existential horror story, timeless and universal. Not to be confused with ""The Sandworms of Dune"". First off, there's a lot less space travel in this one."
The Woman in the Dunes,2,"June 14, 2015","Bizarre and claustrophobic, it definitely reminded me of Dino Buzzati's The Tartar Steppe, but somehow didn't manage to work its magic on me as the latter most certainly has. It reads like a Kafkaesque nightmare, it is strange and surreal, it is filled with deep existentialist questions, but it suffers from an off-putting protagonist, casual misogyny and gratuitous rape."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"November 21, 2012","A swirling, Sisyphean nightmare of Kafkaesque proportions."
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"July 17, 2017",Kafkaesque but not Kafka-like.
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"September 25, 2015","Could be described as Kafkaesque, but I was reminded more of Ionesco. That's a good thing."
The Woman in the Dunes,3,"January 18, 2014",It was Kafkaesque
The Woman in the Dunes,4,"June 25, 2024","Strange, unsettling and Kafkaesque Japanese novel."
harry potter and the half blood prince,5,"September 12, 2017","The characters in Harry Potter were plotted out perfectly by Rowling. Harry Potter's fear is balanced out by Ron’s humor, Harry being somewhat naive is balanced out by Dumbledore's cunning and intelligence up until almost the last chapter. “It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.” Said Dumbledore to Harry. Over all with a this book is a very good read that I would certainly recommend to any reader but especially to readers who enjoy fiction. The book has a kafkaesque-melancholy feeling to it making it more realistic and enjoyable."
the judgement,3,"June 1, 2018",We're convinced at the beginning about Georg's fortune and his stature as an impeccable person who's stoically supporting his family and doing seemingly well for himself until his father's tirade brings about the kind of shame that every child would rather die than endure. The shame that is preceded by a wake up call from someone close when they describe to you the ways in which you have not only let them down but evoked contempt and disgust for them. Georg never stood a chance. The niche of a father-son relationship where the father brings his son to task over his character as described in this story is the kafkaesque and harsher rendition of a core theme that defines all father-son relations; the father being the harsh mentor and captain and the son being the forever inferior and loyal mentee.
the judgement,4,"February 20, 2023","The more I read his work, the more I become interested in Kafka. When I first started reading him, I was quite put off. I found his style very rough and difficult to ease in to. But, after getting more acquainted with his work, I’m actually starting to enjoy the lunacy. I have a much better grasp on what ‘Kafkaesque’ means now, and I would be more than happy to read more of his work in the future."
the judgement,5,"January 29, 2025","Oh my gosh, not only is this pretty interestingly written with pretty much perfect structure and everything you're looking for in a good story, but the ""Kafkaesque"" is really shining and adds such a specific taste that I can never forget."
the judgement,4,"July 8, 2025","It is tempting to try and take a lighter look at the works of Franz Kafka, maybe because the atmosphere is so gloomy, tragedy is otherwise in the air, and as a ‘defense mechanism’, instead of accepting what is inevitable, in this context, nothing good can be conceived, and even then, if we have a character prosperous, somewhat cheerful, advancing in his career, finding a good companion, that is the exception that confirms the rule, it also serves as a contrast, it is all Kafkaesque, so what good does a bit of merriment…"
the judgement,4,"July 12, 2024","typisch 'kafkaesque' mit intrigen, hinterhalten und anklagen bei undurchsichtigen dynamiken"
the judgement,4,"March 13, 2025","A read recommended to start Kafka, as it provides a microcosm of kafkaesque themes. Kafka’s big themes are law, crime, guilt, punishment, and judgment: both the judgment that comes from state authorities and that from more personal qualities, including our own families, and even ourselves."
the judgement,3,"March 22, 2020",We're convinced at the beginning about Georg's fortune and his stature as an impeccable person who's stoically supporting his family and doing seemingly well for himself until his father's tirade brings about the kind of shame that every child would rather die than endure.

the judgement,5,"June 25, 2022","The Kafkaesque elements and the puzzling nature took me into the storyline. If there is even a way to read this story without connecting with Kafka's real life? No, right."
the judgement,3,"December 20, 2024",a bit….yk kafkaesque
The Cat in the Hat,4,"January 1, 2016","Dr. Seuss was one of those rare creative geniuses who both entertained us and challenged us to open our minds. ""The Cat in the Hat"" is an indispensable part of the Seuss canon. A bizarre blending of Seuss's trademark illustrations with an eerily Kafkaesque plot, ""Cat"" will delight both children and adults."
The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol,5,"May 24, 2022","I suppose going forward, I can confidently refer to something in the realist realm, or the fantastical, as Gogolesque, or reminiscent of Gogol, rather than Kafkaesque. Because Nikolai Gogol, a Ukrainian novelist, whose writings circulated a good half-century before Kafka’s birth, surely influenced him. Gogol writes about his time growing up in “Little Russia,” as well as the then-Russian capital of Saint Petersburg, in the collection, The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol, with an English translation by translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, released in 1998. These short stories primarily deal with the themes of individual alienation, “Little Russia” juxtaposed to the big Russian city of St. Petersburg (the collection is literally divided into Ukrainian tales and Petersburg tales), the arbitrariness (or overrated esteem) given to rank, and Russian corruption."
The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol,5,"September 20, 2024",Calling Gogol’s writing “Kafkaesque” is like calling Edgar Allen Poe’s writing “Lovecraftian”.
alice s adventures in wonderland,3,"January 3, 2024","--Unlike Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which I can still find delight in reading as a critical adult given its allusions to 19th century US politics (esp. monetary policy struggles), reading Alice really felt like how Baum tried to frame his own book [emphases added]: Yet the old-time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has come for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder-tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incidents.…At least Alice was a colourful, quirky dream, rather than a Kafkaesque nightmare. Most importantly, I knew that it would be a temporary escape, and that I will return to the real world."
alice s adventures in wonderland,3,"October 17, 2011","As a child I had a picture book version of this story and to this day can remember the illustrations with a slight sense of foreboding. Wonderland is very much a dream world – surreal, fleeting, bizarre, illogical and disconnected. Reading it now does nothing to remove the feeling that for me (I hope it’s not just me) the dream is edging towards nightmare; a fever or drug induced hallucination. Falling, being chased, hookahs, magic mushrooms and all the talking animals appearing from nowhere seem more Kafkaesque than fairy story."
the call of cthulhu,4,"June 6, 2020","By selecting stories from across Lovecraft's oeuvre, S.T. Joshi is able to give us a vertical slice of all the author's strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, it becomes almost funny to watch each story start with a narrator who's gathering the information second hand and who loves to throw words like ""theosophist"" and ""preternaturally"" around like confetti; not to mention the bizarre Britishisms from an American author such as ""showed"" becoming ""shewed"" and ""color"" into ""colour."" Nonetheless, it's also engrossing to watch the same stories develop from pulpy Edgar Allen Poe imitations to early flirtations with the unknowable to the absolute iconic brand of fear that put's Lovecraft in a league with Kafka and Lynch (that is, the league of having a word created to describe the specific vibe: Kafkaesque, Lynchian, Lovecraftian)."
strange metamorphosis,5,"September 30, 2013","The only Kafkaesque element of this book is in the boy's actual metamorphosis, which provides the context for his philosophical musings about where he's going in life. But there is definitely an Alice-in-Wonderland quality as the hapless Marcel shrinks, then grows, sprouts wings and learns to fly. His tiny size allows him to observe the world of humans - especially his heartthrob, Julia - without being noticed. The insights gleaned from this bug-eyed perspective not only help him to mature, but provide the reader with a new way of thinking about our strange world - and a new respect for our insect cohabitants."
Foucault s Pendulum,4,"April 5, 2018","‘Foucault’s Pendulum’ is the opposite of ‘The Trial’, but it’s not so different. K.’s black-and-white shadows are exchanged for grind-house technicolor, equally grainy but with the saturation so strong it bleeds out of the lines. The protagonists could not be more protos, nor more agonistai. They are in every sense the primary aggressors, creating their agon out of boredom and curiosity, only for it to culminate in a Kafkaesque trial. In Kafka's world, however, horror comes from the stillness of an uneasy feeling. (Horror as opposed to terror, that is, because the former shrinks understanding and the latter expands it.) Eco has none of that. His world is surreal, but absurd. The uneasy stillness that horrifies becomes a Bakhtinian theatre bizarre full of grotesque bodies that are quantum-like: at once both laughable and terrible."
El t nel,5,"August 15, 2019","Ernesto Sabato is a great discovery for me personally, he is one of my favorite Latin authors so far. He gives you the Kafkaesque mood coupled with a very unique style that keeps the reader engaged and wanting more."
El t nel,4,"December 13, 2019","A compelling read on existential isolation that, while being a short read, did its job to enthrall me as I practically read it in one sitting! Thematically The Tunnel is a treat to the reader, deeply dark and psychological commentary on the strife experienced by the isolated, misunderstood human soul. There is no complex plot to it, no twists or moments of abject terror, simply food for thought and a kafkaesque delivery of it."
Flowers for Algernon,5,"October 22, 2017",One of the best books I've ever read. I could feel myself tag along with Charlie as he plodded along in the initial stage of his life. The ending of the book did leave a significant impact on me. Leaves a bit of a Kafkaesque touch as it tells you about the limit of human love. Would suggest this book to any person who would like a straightforward yet a book that would make you think about the message days after you're done with it.
Flowers for Algernon,3,"November 9, 2024","I liked **Flowers for Algernon** by *Daniel Keyes* – even though the ending in itself felt predictable, it was very clear that the journey to that ending was the core of the book. It's not an easy question: How much does intelligence determine who we are, and what would happen if our intelligence were to rapidly in- or decrease? While I liked the concept of the book, I can't say that I enjoyed it though … it felt too stressfull with a hint of the kafkaesque for that."
Mort,5,"January 23, 2024","Kafkaesque this, ""New Tolkien"" that... if I ever become a published novelist, I could think of no higher praise than to be called Pratchett-esque."
Reading Lolita in Tehran,5,"April 8, 2009","For women of Nafisi's generation, the changes for women under the Islamic Revolution are Kafkaesque. One day you're a citizen with a career and equal rights that you take for granted. A year later, you're imprisoned in a chador (if not an actual prison), condescended to as a child and lambasted for teaching Austen, Nabakov and Fitzgerald while at the same time being coerced into teaching Western English Literature. Nafisi now lives in the US. I makes me so sad to think of that kind of exile, to yearn for a home that physically exists on the map, but does not exist, any more, for you."
Green Eggs and Ham,5,"November 8, 2021","If your ham and eggs are green, they are rancid. Of course they are! That's what green means! They're poison now. You're going to be sick. Tautological nightmare Sam I Am is trying to convince our protagonist - unnamed, like the children in Cat in the Hat and others in Seuss's Kafkaesque universe - to eat rancid food. Understandably, our hero is reluctant. But Sam I Am won't quit. He uses increasingly brutal tactics to break our hero down. Here he is hitting him with a car."
Green Eggs and Ham,2,"August 21, 2016","When you're a kid, it's easy for the more disturbing elements of this book to sail right over your head. But reading it now with fresh, critical eyes, I must say that it's perhaps the most Kafkaesque story I can remember in my life."
fight club,3,"November 10, 2020","Although the motifs the novel explores are fascinating, the text itself can at times be surprisingly slow and inactive. The Kafkaesque repetition and confusion in the text does not add anything to the work and if anything makes it drag."
fight club,5,"February 17, 2024","If the world is an inescapable, Kafkaesque treadmill, Buddhistic enlightenment might placate you, but it won’t save you. At some point, you will feel the sudden and violent draw toward the abyss."
fight club,5,"November 6, 2014","The narrator of the novel is a perfect eiron for an acerbic takedown of our society: a claims adjuster for an automotive company who travels around the country to inspect cars wrecked in fatal accidents caused by malfunctions and design flaws, he must write reports reckoning the cost to the company of recalling and retrofitting cars against the projected cost of settling future lawsuits. His cynicism is well-founded. Hard not to think of Franz Kafka, maybe the darkest and most surreal writer of the twentieth century, who worked for an insurance company examining the claims of workers killed or dismembered in factory accidents. Little wonder that Kafka wrote of faceless bureaucracies and the mutation of human beings into insects and drones! Fight Club's world is Kafkaesque, but Palahniuk makes (im)modest proposals about how to change the demeaning, dehumanizing and, especially, emasculating oppression of consumerist modernity. Not for everyone's stomach, but a powerful and provocative work of literature."
fight club,5,"December 12, 2012","Just in case i give anything away I'll put a big |SPOILERS!| sign here. Now that we're done with that, let's talk about Chuck Palahniuk's literary debut. Firstly I am surprised that, despite having seen the movie a few times, I was still able to enjoy this novel. Sure, I wasn't able to get the characters, faces out of my head but the book was in my opinion slightly different than the film adaptation. While in the movie the motivation for destroying civilization was freeing people from being slaves to bank debts and big corporations, the book was more about rebelling against inability to be a meaningful part of world's history. Other than that, Palahniuk wrote this book in his trademark way, featuring a bizzare and Kafkaesque look at the world. Here people got so bored with their insignificance and dull daily routines that they would do anything to feel alive. Occasionaly ""Fight Club"" is disgusting, sometimes it's violent and it's often provocative, but it's always worth reading, even if you have seen David Fincher's adaptation. Two big thumbs up from me!"
beautiful ruins,5,"April 11, 2013","So overly wordy and personal delving prelude aside, let me say, without an ounce of guile or dishonesty, that Jess Walter is one of, if not the greatest storytellers working in the English writing world today. The first book of his I read, The Zero, was a truly Kafkaesque novel with touches of Joseph Heller, eminently readable and wonderfully dark. Citizen Vince was a charming and moving story about the potential redemption and even salvation of a man's soul in the voting booth circa the Carter/Reagan years. Land of the Blind was a standard (it was an earlier work of Walter's) but touching meditation on the butterfly effect of the how the children we were reverberate into the people we become as adults. Financial Lives of the Poets was melancholic and even downright somber, with a spot of hope that didn't feel forced or contrived."
best european fiction 2013,4,"July 12, 2017","These are unusual stories. Absurdist, Kafkaesque in many places, or supernatural. A woman who discovers a ""thing"" crouching in the corner of her living room behind the TV set that only gets bigger when her husband returns from a business trip and may be cheating her her. A dishrag that announces it was a person the day before. Some of the stories are a little too confusing or obscure, but overall, this collection inspired me!"
Pedro P ramo,5,"June 25, 2024","We come to the town next to the mouth of Hell, and there's nobody there. Or so it seems. The muleteer tells our narrator to look for a certain person who will put him up, and he does, and things become Kafkaesque from there on. But the potential metaphor of Comala set us up for this, so it isn't jarring."
Pedro P ramo,Not rated,"July 25, 2023",How does one review the Kafkaesque/dream like experience that was reading this book? It was undeniably incredible but I feel unable to exactly define and translate that into a out of 5 star rating. A book that begs to be re-read and maybe then will I feel more able to give it a definitive rating out of 5.
Pedro P ramo,4,"July 14, 2024",Kafkaesque. I've always wanted to write that in review. Unique writing voice. Surreal. I could see it warranting more readings to pick up more on each reading. Not a huge investment as it's short.
rebecca,Not rated,"August 14, 2020","The Kafkaism, so to call it, is found in the fact that the narrator has no more of a fore- or surname (at least before she becomes the second Mrs de Winter) than Josef K in The Trial. The un-dead Rebecca has vampirically sucked all identity out of her. Kafkaesque, too, is the crime at the heart of the novel. It happened in a cottage by the sea. Max went down there with a gun (why?), suspecting that Rebecca had betrayed him with her lounge-lizard cousin Jack Favell. He shot her, we are led to suspect, through the belly, when she taunted him with the fact that she was pregnant with Favell’s baby – the future heir to Manderley. Mysteriously, another woman’s body (which Max criminally identifies as Rebecca’s) is washed up. Was she discovered in flagrante delicto? Did Max kill them both? Du Maurier artfully hints at all these possibilities, but leaves them unconfirmed. The plot has as many holes in it as a colander. This is a mystery novel which does not commit the cardinal fault of most ‘mysteries’ – denouement. The knot is left tangled, teasingly."
rebecca,5,"March 12, 2023","Maybe this isn’t very Kafkaesque, hyper-stoic, niche existential misanthrope, cynical isolationist, masculine loner of me, but I love romances. This is a very beautiful one, and it really breaks away from what would normally be called a “romance.” I loved it, a few unexpected twists throughout, definitely a wonderful read."
The Invention of Morel,5,"June 6, 2024","The Invention of Morel is composed of 36 diary entries, and roughly midway through, our narrator’s anxiety of being caught and sent back into the police custody, comes to a high. The Kafkaesque atmosphere emerges from the narrator’s paranoia of being trapped—his fear of captivity. He alluded twice to his “trial” from which he is now a fugitive. His incarceration, in an analogy to Moreau’s experiments, makes our narrator like Moreau’s incomplete animal-beast, missing something to fill out their humanity. His descriptions are filled with anxious longing for his love of Faustine to be requited."
The Invention of Morel,4,"December 2, 2023","Though the novel suggests a Kafkaesque experience in its characterization and plot settings, referring it so would be understating the originality of Casares's narrative finesse.&nbsp; Borges rightly refers the novel to be a work of&nbsp; ""reasoned imagination"" as the rationale and&nbsp; causality of the fantastic is found in the plot and contained by it. The novel, in that way, bespeaks a redemption of plot's relevance. The highlights of Casares's writing is the language of terseness which he uses to build up both suspense and horror all the while engaging with the themes of alienation and immortality.&nbsp;"
The Invention of Morel,5,"January 1, 2024","It's hard to classify this novella as it pierces through several genres, from gothic to detective to adventure story to philosophical and metaphysical reflections, with tinges of Kafkaesque and Borgesian atmospheres. It's written in plain yet elegant language, and the precision is astounding."
Waiting for Godot,1,"August 4, 2018","In her book of translated Euripides plays, Anne Carson mentions Beckett, saying that when she starts a book of his, it’s always the feeling of “here we go again.” If you’ve read ‘The Trilogy’ novels you’ll know why she feels this way. Someone else I read somewhere called Beckett’s fiction “lawsuits that never end,” which is a nice Kafkaesque description, and fitting since the acerbic citizen of Prague is pretty much the only person that can really hang with Samuel in the landscape of the Zero. It’s one thing to be nihilistic—but to embody the void, is quite another. Why would anyone want to? is a totally valid question. I see Beckett, in particular, because of his obvious sense of humor (stage directions are piss takes, too) as a kind of Loki figure in literature. There’s a fable in Norse mythology that goes like this: The Æsir (Thor, Odin, etc.) were chillin in Åsgaard enjoying how lovely it is to be immortal and beautiful, then Loki shows up. He takes a dart made out of mistletoe and, knowing it’s the only thing in the universe that can kill the most beloved god Baldr, launches it at the god and kills him, to the horror of all the other gods who were just chillin’ and having a good time. The Æesir, in this laborious metaphor, are the great writers of fiction from Homer till now. Åsgaard and the fun that is had there is the magical and immortal possibility that beautiful literature can achieve. Loki is Samuel Beckett. An asshole, then, but every bit as true and valid as the rest."
Waiting for Godot,4,"March 27, 2019","This is from the Visibility lecture and concerns Beckett's style. As of the content of Godot in particular, I think it could have found a place in the first lecture as well, Lightness, alongside Kafka, who's mentioned there, and whom I mention here, because there is something Kafkaesque in the (self-imposed) impasse of the characters in Waiting for Godot."
Waiting for Godot,4,"April 18, 2023","Interesting, quick read. Kafkaesque play which amuses with its absurd characters and dialogue. It is written in a way that is rather open to interpretation, which in turn allows the actors to show off their talent. It is also ripe for endless debates about its meaning. It revolves around five characters, including the titular Godot who never appears. Estragon is primitive, visceral, driven by physical needs and keeps forgetting. Vladimir is more cerebral, inquisitive and the obvious leader of the duo. As the only one that remembers, he is the link who holds the story together. They have a long history together and seem inseparable. Pozzo is haughty, bossy, spoilt and entitled. His master-servant relationship with Lucky is a curious one, which doesn't change even when he loses his vision. Lucky is servile to an almost sadomasochistic degree. Yet he is not feeble and can be aggressive towards strangers. There are possible parallels in relationship of the two pairs. Even the tree, the rope and the bags all have possible symbolism. There are themes of Christianity, waiting, time and duty."
Waiting for Godot,4,"November 18, 2023",Beckett’s Kafkaesque masterpiece.
Demian,5,"February 1, 2021","Nietzsche is only one influence here – Jung being the other. So, in part this is a game of follow the symbols and the interplay of oppositions. Some Gnostics used to believe (perhaps they still do) that Jehovah was a lesser God, and that the other Gods let him think he was the only one. And then, despite having made a bit of a botched job of creating the universe, He believed, and his creation believed, that he was the one, true God. I’ve always loved the idea of us being the creation of a second rate God. These Gnostics then believed that we needed to somehow bypass Jehovah, to speak with the real managers. All a bit Kafkaesque, if played on an even larger stage."
Fear and Trembling,4,"April 7, 2020","3. The differences between a tragic hero—typical in Greek mythology; a hero who usually sacrifices himself for the universal (for others) and a „knight of faith”—one who is in constant tension with himself and the outside world; there is no resolution, no tears and no applause from others, because he „cannot speak”, cannot make himself intelligible to others (very Kafkaesque if I may say)."
The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,4,"February 4, 2025","It is said that Rainer Maria Rilke’s lone novel is an autobiographical account. Its tone is often desperate and lonely, landing somewhere between the bombastic insular writings of the “Underground Man” of Dostoevsky with flashes of Kafkaesque absurdity and hints of what Céline would take on to be his voice in Journey to the End of the Night. Malte, 28, is an expat living an impoverished life in Paris. He sees ghosts in his past and disfigured patients in his present. If his life is a cup of coffee, it is one where the filter has been breached and each sip contains unappealing sediments. Yet, despite his loathsome conditions, he is an educated man. You might call him an aesthete for he spends much time in the library reading over poetry and thinking about art. And while he’s too frightened of being judged by the guards in the Louvre, he still manages to mull over the way art affects him."
The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,3,"November 11, 2013",parts are kafkaesque....
Kindred,4,"November 25, 2022","In my opinion, it's a rare novel that uses time-travel both creatively and believably, but Kindred is certainly one of these few-and-far-between masterpieces. Octavia E. Butler's Kafkaesque narrative follows Dana, a 26-year-old black woman, as she is pulled between 1976 California and antebellum Maryland where her ancestors reside. Dana's trans-generational journeys give an unflinching and unforgiving view of American slavery and its afterlives, reminding readers that— far from living in a post-racial society— we all, black and white alike, carry the wounds of slavery into the present."
Kindred,4,"August 20, 2019","The whole time travel thing was hard for me to accept — it felt very Kafkaesque in that it had no explanation. But I decided to keep reading, and I’m glad I did. While there is still no explanation as to why time travel is suddenly a thing for Dana, it works really well by the end (thematically speaking)."
Kindred,5,"December 10, 2019","A classic, for good reason. The setup (a black woman in the 70s find herself transported through time to a Maryland plantation) is, of course, a fascinating mix of kafkaesque disaster and American politics and history, and the characters—none perfect and all compelling—play it out brilliantly."
Letters to Friends Family and Editors,5,"March 5, 2016","His letters are wonderful like all well written letters should be. You'll find pieces of advice, weird anecdotes and stranger metaphors spinning off as stories which can only truly be explained as Kafkaesque. Some you will understand, some you'll only have an impression of understanding but not quiet understood. Most of all beautiful, true written words. Read it in small chunks, read it in big chunks, but that's all it is. Pieces of a whole. You don't get to the other side of the letters, you don't know what was he replying to. And the setting isn't familiar to you at all. What you have is only some pieces of the picture puzzle, and as you go through you get the glimpse of the whole. You don't quiet understand what it is. Nevertheless it is breathtaking."
The Master and Margarita,5,"June 24, 2021","Something I also found really interesting was Bulgakov’s exploration of mental illness and how Russian authorities responded to cases. Bulgakov himself was a victim of shell shock, anxiety and depression in his days, and one can see a vivid portrayal of mentally ill patients, especially in the character of the Master, said to be modelled after Bulgakov himself. The Master, who is introduced late into the novel, is clinically depressed after publishers reject his manuscript - his life’s work - and he is stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare of never facing up to his potential, of losing faith in himself and in his writing. The burning of manuscripts is significant as Bulgakov had done that himself at one particularly low point, with good reason. Written as a ‘drawer manuscript’, Bulgakov wrote this book despite knowing the dangers of writing such a subversive work. He called it his “sunset novel”, as he approached the end of his days, and he knew it would not see the light of day any time soon, even as he wished and hoped that things would soon get better. It was published in 1962-63, around thirty years after his death. And the vast popularity and success of this novel was testament to a line written by Bulgakov, uttered by Woland: “Manuscripts don’t burn.”"
The Master and Margarita,3,"May 11, 2013","Bizarre, absurd, slap-stick, Kafkaesque, Celine-like, Dostoevsky-worthy, and the like. The adjectives and accolades and comparisons used to describe this book over the years are endless, including: ""the greatest novel of the 20th century."" Come on now. I've liked every Russian writer I've ever invited into my brain and Bulgakov is no exception, however, being witty or clever doesn't automatically place you in the echelon of literary greats. In my opinion it was a fine book, and the sections dealing with Pontius Pilate are magnificently written, but it wandered around so that I frankly had a difficult time keeping track of just what was happening to who and when. And the ""wackiness"" of the unexpected didn't quite go far enough to keep me sufficiently interested."
The Master and Margarita,5,"February 4, 2018","These nascent observations merely scrape the surface of interpretation. This novel is a masterly and complex interpolation of Nietzschean nihilism, Kafkaesque confusion and Goethean horror."
The Master and Margarita,5,"December 3, 2012","Besides the introduction of the Devil, the story is quite absurdist, Kafkaesque if you will, and probably at today's standards would be classified as fantasy or magic realism, probably the primary reason Bulgakov got away with it at the time."
The Master and Margarita,4,"June 15, 2024","I think Bulgakov's biggest strength plot-wise is the ""scenity"" of the episodes, the Kafkaesque nature of the chapters mixed with the supernatural aspect. Characters find themselves in ridiculous, absurd situations and they constantly feel alienated, but unlike Kafka's characters, this absurdity is not imposed by Soviet society (that's almost a given from the author's perspective) but by the magical aspect they cannot come to grip with, given the profound rationalisation and politicization of their souls."
The Master and Margarita,5,"June 11, 2025","I'm more of quippy-sarcastic-one liner review kind of guy, because you shouldn't be reading these anyways, but for this once I will write something sober. Having finished the book a few months prior, I've had time to reflect (read:forget): books of this kind, books that heavily feature religious motifs, are special in this idiosyncratic sense where to write something like this the author a) has to have been religious/raised religiously at some point in their lives, enough so that they have absorbed the minute cultural details and the headspaces connected to religion, but also b) has to be blasphemous/radical enough to take these concepts and toy with them, recast them and bend them. Now combine this with a kafkaesque 20th century soviet sensibility and the russian sense of dark humor and you get a prose that's almost bursting at the seams from the heaviness of everything that was boiled down to make it, yet fluid because the text itself blooms in your mind later to reveal all the scaffolding beneath."
The Master and Margarita,2,"August 15, 2018",Kafkaesque
The Master and Margarita,3,"June 14, 2018","This condition, of a brow beaten cowardice and spiritual isolation is where Mikhail Bulgakov’s voice finds it’s most poignant expression in his struggle against fear and the naturalization of repression that flooded the literary scene in Moscow and beyond. What the author accomplishes here in the narrative is that rare act where biblical parable is inverted and used against institutionalized authority. For in the construction of a fabulous narrative, that dares grapple with the holy encountering judicial power, the meeting of Yeshua (Jesus) with the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate, Bulgakov presents the most compelling challenge to the state propagated atheism of the regime. This however simultaneously serves as an allegory of the wandering philosopher, inhabiting only the position of an exile caught in the Kafkaesque machinations of state power and the hairsplitting over jurisdiction and testimony. This encounter, as the noted literary critic Richard Pevear observes, enacts itself as the overarching measure of the novel, it’s sublime counterpoint, at once beyond the survey of the myriad of machinations in Moscow where the devil walks in, while also being the subject of the ‘master’s’ crowning achievement, his last novel."
The Master and Margarita,3,"November 6, 2019","I was curious about this novel (and author) that I somehow missed in earlier years when I was partial to Russian novelists. This novel, though, proved to be more Kafkaesque in its absurdity: essentially, Satan comes to Moscow and wreaks havoc. Although a greater understanding of the history at the moment of its writing may have added to the novel, not having that context did not detract from it. Perhaps because it has been a while since I negotiated long Russian names, I found I had to retrace story lines of some characters as the novel moved among them. I am glad to have read it but would only selectively recommend it."
The Master and Margarita,3,"April 5, 2024","Thought this would be kafkaesque, I've been lied to"
The Master and Margarita,4,"June 24, 2017",This is a difficult novel to classify. Is it a fairy tale? A horror story? A Kafkaesque fable? A historical novel? An early example of magical realism?
The Plot Against America,5,"May 5, 2016","Why o why did I not discover Philip Roth earlier? He takes you by the hand and leads you through his real childhood reflected through a Kafkaesque lens of Lindbergh becoming an pro-Germany, anti-intervention, president instead of Roosevelt."
A Hunger Artist,4,"October 24, 2018","Kafka is so good at what he does, but these have a slightly different flavour too them. They’re not what you would term as directly Kafkaesque; they have nightmarish qualities and oppressive undertones to them, but the characters are not aware of their sufferings. They don’t feel trapped like K. did in The Trial. They don’t know that they are being consumed by their own pursuit for brilliance within their respective disciplines. They feel normal."
A Hunger Artist,5,"September 15, 2021",Kafkaesque.
A Hunger Artist,4,"March 31, 2018","A Hunger Artist is though surreal, resembles humanity, artist's desire and his aim in the art itself, is prominent. Kafkaesque in the story depicts the solitude condition in an alienated art."
A Hunger Artist,5,"January 18, 2019","Kafka is great. The endless interpretive fertility of his work keep him beloved and relevant even today. It is true, A Hunger Artist is a rich, rewarding story. Kafka turns the spiritual abstinence of fasting on its head through the arrogance and sensational cravings of the narrator, simultaneously humanizing and mystifying the superhuman artist. In a letter to his fiancé Felice Bauer, Kafka said: “I do not have literary interests, I consist of literature, I am nothing else and cannot be anything else”. Much like the hunger artist, it would seem Kafka had no choice but to practice his artistry, even when he felt unappreciated. The work’s tone is dinstinctly self-aware, and the Kafkaesque™ features heavily in the defeatist nature of the artists craft: the longer and better he fasts, the further his desire for recognized legitimacy becomes. His very ability to forego desire and need for food places the artist firmly outside the realm of life, which is why his replacement with a youthful panther is so devastating (this act of replacement seems to have been on Kafka’s mind, it is also present at the end of The Metamorphosis where Gregor Samsa is replaced by his sister)."
A Hunger Artist,5,"March 2, 2016",I really enjoy Kafkaesque style of writing. His works are masterpieces...
A Hunger Artist,5,"June 18, 2021","This story might not be termed as Kafkaesque, but it definitely has those nightmarish and surreal elements. It emphasizes on the fact that people are lost somewhere between underlying regret and wishful thinking, that things could have turned out differently."
A Hunger Artist,4,"September 8, 2024","I read A hunger artist years ago when my English was broken and it was hard to get by even a ‘short’ story like this without the help of a dictionary. But isn’t it weird how I chose to read Kafka in English when my English was not good enough and I was 14 at the time so my brain was not comprehending as much either. The only thing was that I actually never knew it was Kafka’s prose until recently, that’s how I picked up this book, to reread and explore the Kafkaesque realm of literature."
A Hunger Artist,4,"September 30, 2019","my interpretation: in a way it mirrors an artist's anxiety to 'perfect' their art form, and that desire to literally die for their art. Kafka wrote this during his last days before he died, and I cant help wonder whether this was a reflection on how he truly felt about his writing. ""Will my art matter after Im dead?"" The ending, true to its Kafkaesque form, says 'no', you wont matter because something else will replace you, like a lively panther who has an appetite for life unlike some miserable dude, in some cold, dark room writing about turning into a monstrous bug! (sarcasm, but really Kafka is a great writer, though he had depression)"
A Hunger Artist,5,"November 10, 2020","Franz Kafka is often perceived as having literary prestige when it comes to producing horrific, nightmarish, and mysterious storytelling, even coining the term Kafkaesque. A Hunger Artist does not fall short from being infamously Kafkaesque--the hunger artist himself, a man who is continuously fasting struggles in the perils of what it means to not measure up to one's own standard/expectation of life--influencing his overall quality of life. Despite being such a short story, Kafka's protagonist when troubled provides meaningful depth as to what it means to exist in the conviction of prizing the art that we create over the creator."
A Hunger Artist,4,"February 15, 2024",Typically Kafkaesque🎀.
A Hunger Artist,4,"March 16, 2020","Great little short story. Dark and twisted, as to be expected from Kafka. To me this is the most accessible story of his so far, but perhaps the least ""kafkaesque"" too."
A Hunger Artist,3,"September 19, 2020","I liked it quite a lot. It was fun and well written. The ending makes it far greater. Short, good, kafkaesque."

A Hunger Artist,2,"October 7, 2021","Calling one of Kafka's works kafkaesque  might not sound like a very profound assessment. It's a perfectly apt indication, however, of how profound this story is."
A Hunger Artist,2,"January 3, 2024","Kafkaesque como siempre, pero nada del otro mundo."
A Hunger Artist,3,"March 1, 2023","After Kafka’s publications, scholars would call certain scenarios “Kafkaesque” which is used to describe a complicating and frustrating experience. The word describes all too well the nature of being put into a distressing situation and needing to achieve a goal to get OUT of that situation which is so unnecessarily difficult and tedious which leaves the person wondering if the goal is even worth it at the end."
A Hunger Artist,5,"October 19, 2024","Is what he’s looking for, truly, only food? Is he alluding to something else? He desires something he actually wants, for if he did, he would have been “normal” and eaten like everybody else, but as the Kafkaesque fate would have it, the absurdity of it all, he simply could not be satisfied, and fasting, to him, became life’s purpose i guess. Fasting, to him, is not an act that people think it is— a circus show— but something he doesn’t really have power over?"
A Hunger Artist,5,"March 2, 2024","I can't describe how sad this story made me. In spite of its metaphorical nature, I found the story to be extremely dark, which is exactly what I appreciate about Kafka's work. In this story, he uses his usual Kafkaesque elements, such as torture, alienation and madness, which not only tortures the hunger artist but also the reader."
A Hunger Artist,5,"August 31, 2023","A short Kafkaesque read that you won't be able to put down once you start; It will have you pondering over self-preservation, the pursuit of perfection and failure."
A Hunger Artist,4,"July 2, 2016",Hail Kafkaesque!
Heart of Darkness,4,"June 20, 2025","Marlow's appreciation for him, despite not having the opportunity to see what the others enchanted by him saw, is at first confusing to the reader. Only when the other men who thrive in their kafkaesque yarn of systems and processes doom Kurtz for dead does Marlow begin propping up the man as a legendary figure."
the factory,4,"September 5, 2022","There are few better readymade metaphors for the feeling of one’s self as a forgettable cog in a meaningless machine than a factory. Some people may thrive in them, but for those who are quick to reach for terms like ‘kafkaesque’, factories can really take on a sense of absurdity and futility when you watch your life slip by on a conveyor belt of working to exhaustion, sleep and repeat. Hiroko Oyamada’s The Factory--translated by David Boyd--dives headfirst into this metaphor and resurfaces dripping in dread and anxiety but with a charmingly surreal story to tell. The novella follows three characters who have each taken a job in The Factory, a massive company in a building the size of a major city that employs much of the region and pays well though nobody is quite certain exactly what they make. As time starts to unravel and the borders between life and work blur, the characters each question if they have lost all sense of purpose in life and if any can be found through work at all. Darkly humor abound, Oyamada’s devilishly surreal fable of factory life is a sharp critique of work culture and the impenetrable bureaucracies that make us all cogs in their machines."
the factory,4,"December 27, 2019","Well, I hate the word Kafkaesque except in this case it really is appropriate - this slim translated novel is about three people recently hired to work at a sprawling, city-dwarfing factory, the kind that has bus routes and restaurants to support the workers (or is it to keep them there?) One woman shreds paper at a job she is overqualified for, one man is proofreading documents by hand and battling sleep, and one bryologist has been tasked with something both impossible and that don't seem to actually want him to accomplish."
the factory,3,"June 5, 2022","This is not the first book that I’ve read that satirizes the gig economy. The Factory wasn’t quite as inventive and engaging as say Temporary. Also, the use of multiple narrators resulted in a less focused storyline. Whether this was intentional or not, I found myself wishing for a more introspective read. The characters populating this book are half-formed caricatures that didn’t quite succeed in capturing a certain type of person/worker. Still, The Factory does read like a contemporary Kafkaesque tale. There is an interview scene very early on in the narrative that felt really spot-on."
the factory,4,"January 3, 2025","Very kafkaesque in its exploration of the perpetual bureaucratic ambiguity, absurdity; indifferent and dehumanizing forces of modern corporations. Daddy Kafka would be proud"
the factory,1,"January 11, 2020",So boring! Kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did. Maybe that was the point but I work for a living so don't need to read about this. No humor or irony. So overrated. Not Kafkaesque at all. There was no sense of dread or horror. No one felt much of anything except annoyance at a brother's girlfriend. No character development. I will go back to my Soseki or Enchi.
the factory,3,"December 9, 2019","“With hints of Kafka and unexpected moments of creeping humour, Hiroko Oyamada is one of the boldest writers of her generation.” So says the blurb. “Hints of Kafka.” Makes it sound like a bottle of plonk: not full-bodied Kafkaesque but Diet Kafka. I mean I get where the marketers are coming from—the name Kafka sells books—but what they’re really saying here is Kafka would’ve done a much better job which he would’ve. And, to be honest, so would Gabriel García Márquez. Unfortunately neither was available and so Oyamada did her best and she didn’t do badly but I can’t pretend I hadn’t begun this book hoping for more. What I got intrigued me and kept me reading to an ending I wasn’t expecting or quite understood but there was a little too much left unanswered for me. Even Lost tied up its major plotlines."
the factory,3,"December 8, 2019",The writing in this book is simple and the story is uneventful till the very end where there is a Kafkaesque twist. It hit close to home in a way.
the factory,4,"December 9, 2024",A recommendation if you’re into a surreal vs realism plot or love kafkaesque related fiction esp on existentialism and bureaucratic absurdity theme.
the factory,4,"February 2, 2020","I know the term “Kafkaesque” gets thrown around with great abandon these days, but if Franz Kafka were alive to witness the apotheosis of capitalism, his response might have been to write something very similar, if not identical, to The Factory. Oyamada’s setting has a distinct Kafka-vibe, the factory situated in a liminal space that straddles the real and the fantastic. Beyond its sheer size, there’s an uncanny characteristic to the factory’s ecology, including an overabundance of moss, coypus that are far larger than they have any right to be, and a species of black cormorant that flock near the river, never seem to die, and whose numbers are increasingly growing. Oyamada even pauses the narrative to include a report from a schoolboy (proofread by Yoshiro’s brother) that provides meticulous detail on the factory’s fauna. It’s all remarkably disquieting and unnerving."
the factory,2,"December 26, 2023","if this is a good kafkaesque type book then oh boy,i'm gonna hate kafka 3/10"
the factory,Not rated,"March 28, 2020","There are moments of humor here but rarely did anything evoke more than the thinnest of smiles from me, a recovering chuckler. Went in thinking I'd be in for some cheekily absurd book on factory work, by the Kafkaesque qualities are rarely in sight and I soon recognized that the feeling in myself while reading that I took for intrigue and mystery were merely boredom propped up by coffee."
the factory,4,"May 20, 2025","I'd argue that the factory itself is a main character. It is a self-sufficient town, complete with living facilities, shopping areas, entertainment, a hundred cafeterias, and all kinds of services. The factory is surrounded by nature. It's a sprawling and unknowable place with strange features like a bird infestation, coypus breeding in the sewers, lizards that eat detergent, and a pervert is living in the forest nearby. It's also a little sinister and kafkaesque as the employees are warned not to bring documents home or to obey the rules because ""you never know who's watching.” There’s even a factory anthem??"
the factory,4,"April 26, 2024","It centers around 3 protagonists, all ""blessed"" with jobs that feel far more like curses in the respected factory. The factory has everything. Restaurants, convenience stores, an abundance of nature, a temple and shrine complete with priest. To quote the mysterious middle manager Goto, ""the only thing it's missing is a graveyard"" (come to think of it, what the hell happens to the dead? We get zero indicators and although it seems they'd just be buried in an outside graveyard, thats way too innocent for this whole kafkaesque world""). One, a literature major, shreds documents for 7.5 hours a day, a cruel twist of irony. Another one, the literature major's brother, was sacked for no reason from his engineering job, and now does nothing but proofread documents of nonsense that follow no theme or topic. The last one is hired to green-roof the entire factory themself, but is given no timeline, no deadline and no one to be accountable to. All he does is lead an annual moss hunt and classify moss all day."
the factory,4,"December 20, 2019",There is a Kafkaesque tint to the theme of this novel and yet not. Kafka's hero K was convinced by society of his guilt. Their is some meaning there even if it is imposed arbitrarily. These characters cannot get their society to explain anything to them. They are provided for physically but left empty psychically. They function as economic units but have no idea of what their economic function is.
the factory,2,"January 2, 2020","Hiroko Oyamada has been compared to Kafka, but I think with this book (which I believe is one of her earlier works) that might be a little generous. The book is abstract and has characters that are unsure why they're in the bizarre situation they're in, but I don't think that should be the only hurdle to being Kafkaesque. Kafka also has characters that you care whether or not they reach a resolution, and you are drawn in by the inescapability of their plight."
the factory,3,"July 19, 2020","I got this from a NYT list of recommendations and read it on the beach this last weekend due to its short length. It is a bit too cerebral for that which may have been a part of why it didn’t hit well with me. The blurb in the back of the book describes it as Kafkaesque and that is dead on. Living in the Bay Area, this book seemed extremely relevant to places like Google or Facebook or startups that serve their employees every need so there’s no need to leave. There’s an interesting contrast between the proof readers girlfriend, who is completely bought into the factory, and he and his sister who are more disillusioned with their monotonous lifestyle. Moreover Oyomada proves herself to be an author with a lot of potential and a lot of ideas and I’m excited for her to keep writing."
the factory,3,"February 12, 2020","Lots of people call it Kafkaesque, and I guess it is, but I liked the book. It focuses on these characters performing maddening, meaningless tasks at the town's factory, which is a city in itself. They all get used to the work in different ways and their responses to it and the people around them are what make the book interesting."
the factory,4,"March 16, 2020","So... not much ""happens"" in this book, in the way of standard plotlines, but I did really enjoy it. It captures the weirdness, inanity and paranoia of office life sooo accurately, pushing things towards absurd Kafkaesque happenings but staying mostly within a realistic realm. I thought the consistent level of weirdness and tension it created was really excellent."
the factory,4,"April 11, 2020","Creepy, Kafkaesque intertwined stories of workers being drained of life while working at The Factory. I've had jobs like that, while in transition to other, better jobs. I've known, people who've been in those jobs for years. In the book, three people are absorbed into the cogs of the factory, just as the surrounding society is also absorbed. The Japanese salaryman experience may be the clear inspiration for the book, but take a look at the tv series Devs, or Stories from the Loop, or the book The Circle, to see similar comments on modern consumerist society."
the factory,2,"May 3, 2020","I'm always careful to couch my criticisms of translations. I may have missed nuances that did come over in the English or I may well be ignorant of precedents or styles of approach in the local literature. Without those, this comes to me as not Kafkaesque enough to get me excited about it. It also lacks the humour of say a Magnus Mills."
the factory,5,"July 20, 2020","A short, Kafkaesque read with funny characters and surreal interludes to alleviate its crushing depiction of life under capitalism in a factory so large it's essentially an entire world. The interlocking points of view and long paragraphs of unmarked dialogue make it a bit hard to track, but that's kind of the point. Alienated labor in a boundless, spaceless, unmarked space."
the factory,4,"July 22, 2020","A very interesting Kafkaesque approach to the corporation, especially a corporation town where strange animals live."
the factory,3,"January 14, 2020",A book being described as Kafkaesque and having a low page count would have a library hold placed by me 9 times out of 10. I'd enjoy that book 3 times out of 10.
the factory,2,"October 25, 2020","'The Factory' is a Kafkaesque story. People who have had a bullshit job would personally relate to the story, for better or worse, and it's actually horrifying to find oneself in such a situation. It borrows general ideas not only from Kafka, but from Graeber's criticisms and even Joseph Heller's 'Catch-22' (the absurdity of everything). But the book could've been so much better if it didn't delve so much on the characters' emotions, and had the formatting been at least decent. It's a short read that I randomly found in a library. I like the idea; unfortunately, I can't say the same for the implementation. Such a shame."
the factory,3,"May 19, 2022","I'm always skeptical of the word Kafkaesque, but the term simply must be applied to at least one element of this book: the characters metamorphose into animals. Clearly this is not unique to Kafka's work, but the work-atavism connection must here be drawn. The book's main treatment is of industrialized countries and the particular anomie resulting from meaningless work and a normless corporate culture. Our three characters become lifeless and hollow over time, refusing, as they do, to escape from their joyless, purposeless ""occupations."" In the end, they cast off their humanity. Of course, not everyone can leave a job: a single mother cannot afford to shirk responsibility, after all. But our three lovable goons have no dependents, and, it seems, no capacity for individual thought. Of course, they are ""up against"" The Factory, which takes on a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent role throughout the story; the factory dulls them to the point past which they have long ago ceased to question their jobs' various purposes. And thus they continue to edit the uneditable, shred documents, and classify mosses. I think I'm supposed to jive with this more as a Millennial, but I guess I'm not of such a hopeless bent."
the factory,Not rated,"July 24, 2022","The message felt off to me, however, because it stuck to a fairly one-note critique of Kafkaesque work arraignments. I resonate more with the complicated push and pull of something like *Helplessness Blues* by the Fleet Foxes which recognizes the appeal and depersonalizing danger of working as part of a social machine."
the factory,4,"July 24, 2024","I went into reading it expecting a modern 1984 or a Fahrenheit 451 with some drama and plot but I was welcomes into a Kafkaesque world of modern work culture. Now, this may seem like a negative but I guess, this time I needed it. To not hide behind the fantasy and drama but see world reflected as is with a hint of mystery."
the factory,4,"April 18, 2024","Very weird. I enjoyed it. Short story about disconnection, dissociation, meaninglessness, futility, insignificance, existential dread, capitalism, confusion, the workplace. I think Oyamada accomplished exactly what she intended to with this book. I maintained a disquieting sense of unease and foreboding throughout the novella, which never really came to a head… I walked away confused, slightly dazed, and fixated. The Factory is the kind of book that leaves you searching for philosophical or symbolic interpretations even though there are none, but I think that’s exactly the point! The sense of emptiness exp by her characters makes them feel numb and lost just the way you feel after reading it. You want an explanation re the plot and the timescale but there is none. You have no idea what you just read, like you have no idea what you’ve been doing working 15 years at a corporate job. Like she actually did that so well and I’m changing my rating to 4 stars. Definitely see why she won awards for this. Yes, kafkaesque, surreal. To ask questions like “who’s narrating?” And “did it just switch narrators mid-paragraph?” And “where did those 15 years go?” And “why does everyone talk so weird?” And etc etc is to miss the point. This is the entirely meaningless experience of being a cog in a machine, a machine so vast and multifaceted that you cannot begin to understand it from the inside. Those questions don’t have answers because they don’t even have meaning"
the factory,4,"July 19, 2021","Strange, surreal and oddly realistic representation of working for a big corporation. The Factory, a huge business, on an enormous compound with hundreds of departments and employees, but nobody seems to know what the factory does or makes. A nice short novella with a ""Kafkaesque"" feel to it, where you are left with more questions than answers. Told from three different first-person perspectives, you quickly lose track of who is talking and what is being discussed. Everything starts to blend together and blur, heightened by the style of the book itself (long paragraphs, small font, no breaks between dialogue, no chapter names). Oddly funny and honest. A existential examination of working at a big bureaucratic, monster company. What do I do? Why do I do it? What is the point of all this?"
the factory,2,"June 30, 2023","A blurb on the cover calls this novella Kafkaesque. I don’t disagree, but it’s definitely Kafka-lite."
the factory,3,"April 8, 2023","I loved seeing the same story from many points of view. This book is a very kafkaesque reimagination of the modern corporate workplace, and it isn’t far off. I don’t think this book is meant to be taken literally, which is why the ending could feel confusing. We are all cogs in the machine, and as you begin to question, it’s already too late. The point isn’t to figure out why the factory is this way, it’s about how you don’t and can’t know."
the factory,2,"January 24, 2024","Oh my God, I hated this so much. It wasn’t the writing, which others have noted is purposefully meant to blur the lines of reality by switching between timelines and topics without warning or transition. No, it was just the single most boring book I have ever read. Like if someone had turned the most mundane water cooler niceties into a novella, that would be The Factory. And yes, I know it’s a Kafkaesque commentary on capitalism and modern labor. Doesn’t matter. Still boring to the point of being unbearable."
the factory,3,"July 11, 2024","A bizarre little fairy tale of a novella. A sneaky Kafkaesque set piece about late-stage capitalism and ennui and the Groundhog Day drudgery of being a worker. Effective, disorienting weirdness in the way perspective and time shifts as you get deeper in. You end up as dislocated and alienated and bewildered as the characters. Borderline magic realism."
the factory,4,"January 12, 2025","Kafkaesque - not for the sake of it, but quite literally."
the factory,2,"March 7, 2024","""A powerfully strange portrait of the absurdity and meaninglessness of modern life"" —I mean, if I were ever to recommend a book that best describes our contemporary labor force, this would be it. Surreal, absurd, and even Kafkaesque, this is a bleak story about alienation. It got me thinking about the ""work-campuses-communities"" in Silicon Valley. I mean, if your house and your community are situated in your workplace, how do you draw the line between your life and your job?"
the factory,5,"January 24, 2025",It would be very lazy to call this Kafkaesque...
the factory,4,"July 9, 2021","This debut novella is almost begging to be described as Kafkaesque. Three people ending up working at a bizarre factory, trying to make sense of the purpose of their jobs and the strange things happening with animals. It revels in the absurd and can be very funny in places. I'm not sure that it all adds up to that much but it's a fun read."
the factory,5,"October 5, 2021","Chanced upon this during yesterday's trip to the library. Came home and read it from cover to cover - so weird, and so great! Kind of a modern day Kafkaesque / Bartleby in Japan. If you've ever worked in the corporate world, even more so as a temp, you will get this."
the factory,4,"October 15, 2021","This is a great book. A shimmer of a Kafkaesque enterprise, so precisely written. Not a word too much is used, and the story itself comes in the most matter-of-fact way possible. It’s charming in its unpretentiousness, but way smarter than it may look at first. Japanese composure and minimalism at its best."
the factory,2,"September 10, 2023","Here is the thing, I just didn’t get it. I’m sure is way better and profound than I found it. It was hard to read, the format was too dense. I just didn’t fully understand or enjoy it well. Perhaps humor is just too different between me and the Japanese. Perhaps a lot gets lost in translation. Perhaps it being one of my first books with kafkaesque tones made it harder to get."
the factory,4,"October 7, 2024","The term ""Kafkaesque"" is thrown around so much that I think it mostly shouldn't be used. This book, however, deserves it."
the factory,4,"December 8, 2024","I love the topic of pointless jobs and kafkaesque corporate environments, so this was right up my alley. However I am unable to give 5 stars… not sure why. Perhaps because parts of the book are irritatingly surreal, or I was hoping for an ending with more closure. But definitely worth reading !"
the factory,3,"July 8, 2023","I thought I'd like this a lot, with the Kafkaesque approach. Instead I thought it tried too hard to be confusing, which made it more laborious to read and made it less gripping. But there were quite a few solid moments and implicit criticisms of work culture today so I can't say I hated it"
the factory,4,"November 25, 2023",Enjoyably Kafkaesque little novel on the weirdness of office jobs. What do they make in the factory??? I especially enjoyed the section describing the factory wildlife e.g. the washer lizards (that do not exist).
the factory,4,"December 14, 2020",A brilliant Kafkaesque novella. Loved it!
the factory,4,"May 8, 2022",Kafkaesque reminds me of Ian Banks the bridge and the mezzanine by Nicholson Baker almost trip yet very perceptive about work read on flight to Berlin
the factory,3,"May 27, 2022",Not a proletarian novel or an exposition of the condition of precarious conditions brought on by neoliberal labor flexibilization but a Kafkaesque rumination that is not without its own charms
the factory,2,"April 27, 2024",Kafkaesque this and Kafkaesque that I HATE Kafka bro
the factory,3,"August 3, 2024","Not sure what to make of this. It is more than a little Kafkaesque as it deals with the mundane activities of a large factory, where things are not as they seem."
the factory,2,"January 5, 2025","Kafkaesque? Sure, but also the structure makes it extremely confusing. It just felt so hard to try to understand wtf was going idk"
the factory,4,"August 30, 2024","Kafkaesque. Kinda weird and not for everyone, especially as Japanese books translated into English tend to come off as a little dry sometimes."
the factory,4,"January 2, 2025","In the first half of the novel, readers are introduced to the working conditions, practices, and relationships among employees in large Japanese corporations, reflecting some of the author’s personal experiences. However, this part of the novel also reveals an intriguing, Kafkaesque tone—the protagonists are repeatedly caught off guard by their tasks, circumstances and the overwhelming bureaucracy. They are perpetually confronted with the unknown and unfamiliar within the factory’s vast and confusing system, which operates as a self-contained entity, almost like a city within a city."
the factory,2,"April 9, 2025","“The Factory” offers a Kafkaesque exploration of modern work life, highlighting the absurdity and alienation inherent in repetitive, purposeless tasks. While the novella’s themes are thought-provoking, the challenging prose, minimal plot progression, and underdeveloped characters may not appeal to all readers. Those interested in experimental narratives that critique contemporary employment structures may find value in this work, but others might struggle with its abstract and disjointed presentation. ￼"
the factory,3,"September 25, 2024",I hate to throw the term Kafkaesque around too often but here I am. This time I think the phrase is fitting not only in theme but also in style. Large walls of text can be off-putting to me sometimes but for this book I didn’t really mind. I read The Hole prior to this and would love to return to the work of Oyamada in the future.
the factory,4,"December 28, 2021","We suggest you read this book if you like books, but you don’t have to like books, but the factory suggests you like this book and read it from cover to cover. A Kafkaesque novel set in a unnamed Japanese town where everyone works at a factory and should be happy about it."
the factory,4,"August 17, 2023","the way this book was formatted was interesting and a bit hard to get around honestly. there’s no other way to describe this novel other than kafkaesque; theres just no getting around it. difficult to get through in a way, but such an interesting world to build to deliver the message that it did."
Bleak House,5,"February 5, 2025","Grand, technically virtuosic, with a Kafkaesque court case that you never really understand. A labyrinthian book."
Bleak House,3,"July 17, 2016","The theme of Bleak House is, of course, the legal system. The Court of Chancery, lambasted in these pages, was already a defunct system by the time of the novel’s appearance in 1853, but anyone with any experience with the legal system will recognize Jarndyce and Jarndyce as representative of the “justice” system. Bleak House is Dickens’s most Kafkaesque novel, and isofar that his talents were greater than Kafka’s, he manages to out-absurd the man."
Bleak House,5,"June 13, 2023","Tragedies lacking comedy and comedies lacking tragedy tend to disappoint me, because I feel that they miss out on the entirety of the human experience. Bleak House has both heart-rending tragedy and uproarious farce in spades. Yet the humor added a third element that startled me: horror. Death, mania, abuse, neglect, and Kafkaesque legal red tape are the sources of Dickens' comedy, which is black as sin and cold almost to the point of callousness."
Bleak House,5,"October 12, 2018","“Bleak House’ is generally agreed to be Dickens’ greatest work, and I constantly go back and forth with myself as to whether or not to agree or to champion “Our Mutual Friend” instead. I think it's ultimately a draw. Both novels are akin in their darkness of vision; each offers a truly fallen cosmos, although with “Bleak House” Dickens truly does seem to capture Victorian England in its Self, from the dazzling glass halls of its aristocracy to the Kafkaesque corridors of Chancery to the phantasmagoria of the London slums, every character connected by a strand of the web. In my memory, “Bleak House’ always seems to take place at night; its atmosphere is furtive, secret, whispered. It’s also probably the very first whodunit in literature (except perhaps for a few short stories of Poe’s), and the wonderful Mr. Bucket is the great-grandfather of all inspector-sleuths as he unravels the mystery of the incomparable Lady Dedlock, that pitiful prisoner frozen behind a carnival mask, tormented in her own self-made circle of Hell, with Mr. Tulkinghorn to keep the fires stoked."
Bleak House,3,"May 27, 2023","I got this book after reading that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce was based on Jennens v Jennens and the absurd kafkaesque ruminations of the chancery courts in that instance. Dicken's preface states that costs have been incurred to 70 000, which I am assured is a friendly suit and no closer to its termination than the beginning."
Bleak House,Not rated,"June 10, 2011",Kafka must have read Dickens. Bleak House is so kafkaesque. Learning again that the classics are classics for a reason.
absolution,3,"July 13, 2013","The complex structure distanced me, as did the literary, analytical style, particularly in Clare Wald's dialogue. And one imagined scene about a Kafkaesque killing system seemed to have found its way into the wrong novel. Nevertheless, I found it absorbing and interesting, and the pages turned easily."
Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West,Not rated,"March 2, 2016","To make it concrete, in this book, there's no crude male joking, no crude male laughter, despite it being about crude men for three hundred pages - soldiers! That it because the men in this book aren't men, they're ideas about men pretending. What's ""not literature"" is that, the details unrelated to the theme, the life this book is a desert without. Violent ideation and history books dressed up in the language of the bible page after page. Sorry, McCarthy, no. Henry James, Proust, etc, these people have something crucial to teach us about ""life and death"" because they show us how to reach our conclusions. We need more than striking ideas, we need methods to extricate us from the mess that is personal experience. That is why we must ""make it new"" as each new generation disorganizes and re-organizes culture and thrusts it upon the next. This is why the style is so important, so talked about, the style is the substance: to have a style, a grand one like the ""Kafkaesque,""""Jamesian,""""Proustian,"" etc, is to master the variety of experience."
Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West,3,"December 26, 2024","If writing could be cinematic this is it. I’m not sure I read one emotion expressed in the whole book. Felt a bit kafkaesque, possibly profound but over my head."
Crime and Punishment,4,"October 13, 2024","Truly, C&amp;P deserves 5 stars, but I cannot give that last and ultimate prize, not just yet. Let me explain: it IS a masterpiece, it’s brilliant, it’s cold and harrowing, kafkaesque and soul-crushing - but I’d need to read it over several more times to really digest what I’ve read…not to mention grasp those Russian names and their variants."
The Plague,5,"January 8, 2024","The horrors of the plague permeate every page. It is interesting to see it set in Oran, Algeria, which represents a reversal of Camus own life where he returned to Paris under occupation while his wife remained in Algeria. Here, Rieux’s wife leaves Algeria while he stays under occupation. Perhaps it is also, Laura Marris theorizes, because Oran represents an isolated city, ‘a city with it’s back to the sea,’ as Camus wrote in his essay on Algeria in Summer. Isolation and separations are major themes here, with Rambert spending the bulk of the novel trying to flee the city for his wife, only to end up in a Kafkaesque labyrinth of being passed from smuggler to smuggler and delayed again and again before opting to stay and fight. What works quite well is the way Camus triggers historical memory of plagues with his descriptions, recalling the great plagues of history (and now, our own current pandemic). The plague begins with rats coming to the surface to die, which he wrote based on a description of rat plagues by Adrien Proust, the father of great French writer Marcel Proust. As Marris writes in States of Plague, ‘it must have pleased Camus, who felt shut out by the literary opulence of Proust’s milieu, to turn the Proustian teacake into a dead rat,’ done by utilizing Proust’s own family."
The Plague,4,"May 7, 2020","There's much, much more to the book. Camus reveals his philosophy—all its threads and components—with a hodgepodge of characters including a journalist, smuggler, government official, Jesuit priest, and traveler. There are the townsfolk too, a sort of collective character, with a collective fate, many of whom regard their ""peace of mind,"" while plague-stricken, as being ""more important than a human life."" Through them all, Camus/Rieux shows us human nature as he and others may see it, using a journalist and also Kafkaesque narrative style, along with plenty of horrific descriptions, from Bubo lancing to pirouetting rats dribbling blood and to the deaths of children. He puts forth the argument that too many of us take life for granted, that we become overly absorbed in repeatedly playing out our routines, and that when calamity, such as plague, strikes, only then do we realize what freedoms and love we had once possessed. Even then, he tells us, too many of us pine for that comfortable life of habitual routine we used to have, rather than living it presently for a fuller, more meaningful existence, for ourselves and for others."
The Plague,4,"July 1, 2023","Then there are purely Kafkaesque moments, like the mood of the town after this sermon, as reflected here -- “Sermon brought home the fact that they had been sentenced, for an unknown crime, to an indeterminate period of punishment.”"
The Plague,4,"September 17, 2022","Even outside of the obvious connection to the pandemic (and its scarily accurate and penetrating insights of life in quarantine and Western society's reaction to the disease) I have no problem seeing why people resonate with this so much. It presents a relatively genial, optimistic brand of existentialism that confirms the materialistic worldview that dominates our culture already. As a philosophical novel or a Kafkaesque parable (the latter which it really isn't—Camus's facade is much more conventional than Kafka's unmatchable, magnificently detached way of writing fiction) it hardly even sounds original nowadays since it simply cloaks the familiar verbiage of pragmatism and secular humanism in the folds of an intriguing allegorical thought experiment which has now turned into an unthinkable reality. But as a literary text it is a true masterwork. The execution manages that rarely-achieved proportion between objective recounting and creative analysis, with some particular passages of such pastel-like prose mastery that they have embedded themselves in my head. The use of a small cast and a meandering, panoramic, circular narrative in which nothing really happens allows for a slow burn of a reading experience that also perfectly mimics Camus's vision of fatalism. It's that rare novel of ideas that happens to be composed by a master aestheticist, and that signature garden-like care and precision that runs through the history of French fiction is carried on admirably. The novel's lasting power will no doubt be amplified once this all is over, but even if the pandemic hadn't occurred, it would always be a critical milestone of the marriage between art and philosophy and a fine example of a book that people of all persuasions can enjoy and be challenged, engrossed, and stimulated to consider their world and their own constitutions without proselytism or undue bitterness on the author's part—although this, of course, also has the effect of dressing up dangerous ideas in tantalizing garb. Reading some of my GR friends' reviews, I'm a bit surprised at how Camus's messages could be interpreted in a more positive, spiritual light as well. Interesting food for thought as to how much we should know about an author and his/her ""famous"" ideas before we dive into their work."
The Plague,4,"July 29, 2017","While I expected a Kafkaesque end, Camus let humans win the battle against the plague. He wanted a world where love and fraternity could allow us to live better and where human will can win against ""the bleak sterility of life without hope""."
Description of a Struggle and Other Stories,4,"February 17, 2015","Interesting short stories from Kafka. All of whom which represent the struggle of a character someway or another. Some of the stories very introverted, some of them very supernatural. All-in-all, a beautiful plethora of Kafkaesque ingenuity."
Ficciones,5,"February 6, 2023","Fictions introduced entirely new voice into world literature. The collection continues to be among the most read, commented on and alluded to fictions of the century and despite the quality of so much of Borges’s subsequent works, the collection continues to be most sought after book, perhaps have become his identity over the years. What was striking about  Fictions  is that whenever and wherever it come to existence it immediately grabbed the imagination of readers- for it is quintessential for a reader to be imaginative to understand Borges’s world. As we say one overdoes something until one perfects it, Borges has developed a much serene, subtler prose from the baroque style employing strained and startling metaphors from his early days, and mind you that quieter style has beauty of undertones which may take you to so many avenues in so little words. He became so adept at his style in 40s that it got a particular name- Borgesian- like those of Dickensian and Kafkaesque. But there was more than just the style, the unclassificability and originality of these stories were among the most prominent factors which led uncomfortable but curious stir among readers and writers of that time, probably still continues to do in modern world."
Ficciones,5,"February 18, 2015","No Latin American writer of twentieth century has achieved such iconic status as the Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges (Pronounced as Bor-Hess. 1899-1986). During his life, Borges wore many hats. He was, variously, a poet, an essayist, a short-story writer, a librarian, and, for a short time, a poultry inspector. As a hauntingly original essayist and short story writer, his three or four dozen short stories and essays is mentioned in the same breath with the tomes of Thomas Mann or James Joyce. This blind octogenarian (His was a particular kind of blindness, grown on him gradually since the age of 30 and settled in for good after his 58th birthday) became a legend in his own time so much so that ‘Borgesian’, eventually became a common neologism like the adjectives “Orwellian” or “Kafkaesque” ."
Ficciones,5,"February 5, 2022","Ficciones is a collection of short stories by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. Borges is considered one of the key literary figures of South America and his omission from Nobel prize in literature is nothing short of a scandal of sorts (Borges himself commented, ""Not granting me the Nobel Prize has become a Scandinavian tradition; since I was born they have not been granting it to me"".) Like stories of Franz Kafka gave us the label of ""Kafkaesque"", Borges gave us ""Borgesian conundrum"" - defined as the ontological question of ""whether the writer writes the story, or it writes him."" The stories in Ficciones make you wonder the nature of reality (through devices such as fictional writers, mirrors, labyrinths, libraries and dreams), and the miraculous creation of worlds through literature."
the grapes of wrath,4,"January 11, 2025","Such a pertinent book. I’m sure reading it in 1939 was incredibly powerful, and even today the story of the Joad family hits home. Such an indictment of the system that caused the depression, and those that propagate that system. The Kafkaesque struggle for survival while living in a world of plenty makes you just want to burn it to the ground. It’s a miracle they didn’t. Honestly, without the new deal, they might have gone through with it. Europe turned to revolution and fascism. It could have happened here."
Momo,5,"May 18, 2022","But the book has plenty to say as well. Ende's creation is one of the most damning indictments of our modern condition in literature. Everything that the Time Thieves do, we have done to ourselves throughout the course of history, gradually reducing our lives to the most essential, efficient use of our time. Ende advocates time wasting as something wonderful, something we are losing. His grey enemies are brilliant, like Kafkaesque soldiers, born of Orwellian nightmares. However, while Momo is, in essence, a totalitarian fantasy dystopia, it is Momo who triumphs. It's like if Winston in 1984, or Josef K in The Trial managed to break out of their closed, impossible circle of doom. All of the other characters fail and our sucked into the traps - Gigi and Beppo, Momo's best friends, also suffer tragic defeats at the hands of the grey men. Ende wants to show us how unique Momo is, how important her talents are. In the second chapter, Ende explains why Momo is so loved by the people all around her. It is a eulogy to the art of listening and I would consider it one of the most vital chapters one could read to a child or young person. Like Ende says, anyone who thinks listening is easy should try and do it well themselves."
Momo,5,"April 29, 2023","Probably the most important book I've ever read. I read this book at three completely different stages in my life, and each time I feel like I got something entirely new. This book is just brimming with imagination and wonder, and with an incredibly cozy atmosphere. At the same time, the book plays with Kafkaesque and philosophical themes with great success."
Momo,3,"September 10, 2014","It was an interesting book for me. I liked the Kafkaesque style (not sure if it is really Kafkaesque, but for me it is), the concept, the interesting questions and topics the book contains and wonders about, but in my opinion the book is missing something. I can't explain or define it, it is just not as good as it should or could be."
Carrie,5,"November 15, 2024","In the pantheon of high school horror, Stephen King's ""Carrie"" reigns supreme as the ultimate tale of prom-night pandemonium. A shy, telekinetic Kafkaesque Cinderella who, instead of losing a glass slipper, loses her grip on reality and unleashes a torrent of supernatural fury. King’s debut novel is a blend of teenage angst, religious fanaticism, and blood-soaked revenge that leaves readers both horrified and oddly sympathetic."
A Country Doctor,5,"July 19, 2021","This excellent collection of short (and very short) stories is — how else can I describe it? — brilliantly Kafkaesque. They are all very good but I especially like the title story, Ein Landarzt, (A Country Doctor) and Ein Bericht für eine Akademie (A Report for an Academy)"
A Country Doctor,4,"October 13, 2023","This short story is predictably ""Kafkaesque"" and must be experienced. It is hard to discuss its metamorphic elements without giving too much away. Rosa the maid, ""that beautiful girl who has lived in my house for years, and whom I scarcely noticed—""; Rosa says ""People don't know what they've got available in their own house."" Now the groom who crawled out of the pigpen is threatening."
A Country Doctor,Not rated,"December 20, 2021",So i personally rate this 2 stars ⭐️ (its pretty much as Kafkaesque as you can get)

A Country Doctor,4,"July 1, 2022","Karakteristik yg kuat ini menjadi amat terkenal dan khas dgn sebutan ""Kafkaesque"". Karya2 Kafka memang sangat sureal tak ayal seperti mimpi. Dalam cerita ""Kekhawatiran Seorang Kepala Kelurga"", digambarkan dgn jelas surealnya cerita Kafka."

A Country Doctor,Not rated,"May 31, 2019","I spent ten minutes trying to find that clip from Metropolitan where the pretentious protagonist describes a book as 'Kafkaesque', and the heroine replies, 'yes, it was written by Kafka.' But I couldn't find it. Then I was going to post that clip from Annie Hall where Shelly Long and Woody Allen are in bed together, and Shelly Long goes, 'sex with you is really a Kafkaesque experience,' but I don't think we're supposed to think Woody Allen is funny anymore. Anyway, this was a pretty good book."
The Beetle,4,"April 1, 2025","Most people are sure to have their skin crawl upon the almost Kafkaesque descriptions of the beetle, but for a bug lover, i relished every bit of it. The Beetle is a strange, ""ugly"", sexually ambiguous Arabian creature with the magic of mesmerism and transfiguration. There are hints of sexual violation, classism, political standpoints and humiliation throughout. The narrative, emotion and recounting from all the characters painted wonderfully vivid and picturesque scenes in my head. It was horrifying, and beautifully so, played like a film in my consciousness."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,Not rated,"September 21, 2023","This particular storyline is Kafkaesque. There are secret societies, ulterior motives, literary phantoms, and a general consensus on there being no consensus. Every time a resolution seems at hand, it is flung far away, across mountains and oceans. You are tasked to follow up on the truth. If there is a truth. But this confusion is just a vehicle to convey several opinions of the author. On writing, publishing, censorship, and reading. Most importantly reading. Through this book Calvino attempts to explore all books. And in this way, this novel, is a meta-novel. A novel of novels. Not because it has the beginnings of ten novels within it. The fact that it captures within itself, all the possibilities of the creative process in writing a novel, the quandaries in its translation and editing, and the various ways it could be read, makes it an author’s cut of a novel. But unlike the director’s cut of a movie, that is often enjoyed by connoisseurs of cinema and die-hard fans, this novel can be read by any casual reader."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,5,"February 15, 2024","I can certainly imagine the mystique and intrigue of this book wearing off with age and re-reads, but isn't that the joy of a good magic trick? It captures our imagination in the here and now. It certainly captured mine with its unique framing device and almost Kafkaesque web of confusion in the main plot. Mostly though, this was just a really solid collection of short stories, with realised worlds and interesting characters and themes of which, like the MC, I really did want to read more. I don't think the book would have worked if that were not the case. I'm eager to read more Calvino and in general go to the library and pick up another random book in search of the unobtainable and unsaid truth that exists behind so much ink and paper."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"September 1, 2024","Wavered between 3 and 4 stars. It's a goofy, enjoyable book but I dislike postmodernism (hey did you know that books have authors! and readers! and that the author can directly address you! Wow I've literally never thought of that how brilliant you must be a genius) which tends to replace good writing and emotional resonance with childish mind games. This book is very much that, though the alternating ""real"" first chapters of various books are often great. I wonder what it'd be like to only read those and none of the narrative chapters in between. It was fun that, for a moment towards the end, it felt like the real world of the novel was converging with the ridiculousness of the fictional with some Kafkaesque scenes, but Calvino didn't want that to be the chief conceit of the book. Anyways, interesting, funny, somewhat frustrating novel."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"June 14, 2024","There’s also something very Kafkaesque about the way that everyone seems to know what’s going on (or at least thinks they do, and has some explanation to back up their beliefs) expect for you, the Reader, who has no option but to agree blindly with each and every argument that appears, always more convincing than the last."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"February 7, 2022","This was a very interesting book with themes on authorial intent, objectivity, and just the life of authors and readers and the relationships formed between them. As someone who hasn't actually read anything by him yet, it felt pretty Kafkaesque."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"May 20, 2023","I was wondering a lot about greatness while reading this. I don't think Italo Calvino is one of the greats, but I do love what he does. There is something a bit Borgesian about this, maybe Kafkaesque or maybe a bit more delightfully Snicketesque, and I think Calvino almost earns his own adjectivification, but not quite. This is a series of beginnings, a collection of stories by an author that doesn't enjoy writing the ends, a love letter about reading and then on the contrarywise a bit about writing, like the man from Borges who determines to write Don Quixote or like the man from DFW who determines to make the ultimate entertainment or like the man from Nabokov who gets tangled in the endnotes of _Pale Fire_. All wrapped in a delightful second-person framing device of international intrigue, conspiracy, and apocrypha."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"May 6, 2018","Wow! That was different. The first chapter was intriguing, no doubt. However, very soon I began to feel disconnected from the stories. I didn’t invest myself in them because I knew they wouldn’t go anywhere. Eventually this became frustrating, even Kafkaesque (but not in a good way). It was incredibly post-modern, e.g. ""If a systematic uncertainty as to the identity of the writer had kept the reader from abandoning himself with trust- trust not so much in what was being told him as in the silent narrating voice..."" Yep. I feel like the author was making some sort of philosophical comment on society, censorship and democracy, specifically the role of reading in our ability to be free and be controlled (especially in Chapter 9), but the story is so convoluted and disjointed it is difficult to really understand his meaning. Also I found the love/sex scenes were impersonal and detached, often with a violent undertone. What I did find very interesting was that each alternate chapter title, when put together, created an intriguing poem (somewhat discussed at the end). Ultimately, I think he is saying reading means different things to everyone. Maybe. This was a truly ambitious undertaking that unfortunately fell flat for me. I am a Reader that does require a beginning and ending to be satisfied. The novel provided far too many of the former and too little of the latter. Perhaps it will be more satisfying for other Readers."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,5,"January 9, 2025","This has to be the most creatively written book I’ve read, nothing else I’ve come across so far is like it, and I struggle to explain this to others. Some parts of this book felt like it went over my head and some parts were so poignant and insightful, I did at times feel like I was being directly addressed. I loved how self aware this book is and how it doesn’t just break the fourth wall, it destructs what you believed were the walls to begin with. Some parts were so winding and disorienting you just had to let the author take you where he wanted and trust you would understand in the end, many moments felt Kafkaesque in its absurdity."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"October 9, 2024","A book about books and reading: post-modern, metafictional, twisty and turny, often Kafkaesque and absurd, or Absurd, with lots of run on sentences like this one. I got a bit irritated with it but can appreciate the cleverness, although its heavy-handed male gaze hasn't aged well. The title is the first of ten fragments, each of which is the title of an unfinished story embedded in the main narrative, such as that is, and together make up one sentence. I enjoyed these tantalising little snippets, and the final thought that 'the ultimate meaning to which every story refers is the continuity of life, or the inevitability of death'. I don't know if that's actually true but it sounds impressive."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"October 26, 2024","Read like a bookworm's wet dream that turns into a nightmare, but also sort of a comforting one? Like a mash of Kafkaesque/ Borges/ Matryoshka Doll with the inserted insight on writing process and the exploration of the complex experience in reading. Writing is extremely good and compelling, with the author somehow able to build momentum through fragmented, interrupted stories. Undercurrent running themes of interconnectedness, of isolated souls and the impossibility of isolation, of multiple faces and stories which truly is a whole, the blending of perspectives of the writer's and the reader's, and the story's and the characters'."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"June 2, 2020","This book is a Kafkaesque tale of a Reader who just wants to finish a book. I love reading as much or more than most people so this is something I can relate to. I was grabbed by this book and the author's description of starting a new book immediately. But about partway through (about when we get to the publishing house), the Kafkaness of the tale got exhausting and I also just wanted to sit and finish a book."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"November 20, 2023",Kafkaesque.
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"December 30, 2024","7/10, very interesting concept mixed with philosophy and a touch of kafkaesque."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"February 7, 2017","Of course for a story about unfinished stories, those unfinished stories had better be enticing. Calvino writes with an air of self confidence that is so justified. Without fail the stories draw you in, envelope you into the settings, lock you into the characters' mind-states, torment you with allusions and intrigue. Some express a tender and vulnerable humanity without slipping into romanticism; others show man's more vulgar underbelly in a curiously nonjudgemental manner. All of the stories carry an air of the surreal. At times this is pushed far into the background and merely provides a curious framing for otherwise seemingly normal stories, other times we are confronted with full-on Kafkaesque bizarreness. This all serves to shake the foundations of reality within the novel in an unnerving way. The stories seem to float in a strange isolation, moments that cannot be slotted back fully into the normal passage of time and of life."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"February 19, 2017","I loved how Calvino describes reading in the opening chapter and then how he inserts bits of the writing and reading process throughout the book. I'm also frustrated, because like the Reader, I want to continue reading all of the beginnings. There were a few bits, namely Chapter 9, that were a bit too Kafkaesque for my taste."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,5,"March 26, 2019","This is a witty bit of literary surrealism in which ten beginnings of ten different novels are linked by a framing story where ""You"" (the reader) and the book itself become characters (although it's never the right book). Eventually those unfinished novels become cheap, lurid imitations (supposedly written by machines) and the framing story spins itself into a Kafkaesque (but never quite serious) tangle of totalitarian censorship amid plots within plots within plots - and it comes to resemble those cheap imitations. Throughout, something is being poked fun at, though we're never exactly sure what: perhaps it is the over-intellectualization of literature; perhaps inept publishing companies (did Calvino have to deal with one of those?) or perhaps it's an allegory about bureaucracy. Whatever. I found it amusing, if sometimes frustrating, and parts of it made me laugh out loud. ...and then there's that joke about the titles near the end, which took the entire book to set up...!"
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,2,"April 20, 2025","And even though I found it intriguing, I didn't enjoy it enough to put in the work to decipher what must be buried under all the layers. The second-person narration, story-within-story structure, and Kafkaesque plot engaged my brain but not much else. So maybe I'll revisit sometime when I'm looking for a book that's half puzzle, but for now I don't feel any urge to dig deeper into it."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"April 28, 2014","The writing deserves five stars, the entertainment value only two (being generous--I ended up skimming the last third of the book), and they average to three. The main story in 2nd person POV (you) meets your reading mate, Ludmilla, or her sister Lotaria, and every book you or they start reading (I think there are nine) is defective and ends shortly after beginning, or is snatched away, or segues abruptly to another book. The books are in 1st person (I). As you scramble through your world, part real, part fiction, becoming more and more Kafkaesque, you (the reader) become more confused until it all becomes meaningless. At least it did for me. The beginning was ingenious and fascinating; the ending was boring and pointless."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,3,"July 24, 2016","This is kind of a difficult one for me to rate. I can appreciate the skill of the author in writing such an unusual book, which I would probably call the ultimate meta-novel. But, I didn't really care for it all that much. Which is strange, because I generally enjoy books like this. And I did like parts of it: the humor, the irony, the bizarre, Kafkaesque disorder and frustration experienced by you, the ""Reader;"" only the book as a whole didn't really do it for me. I guess it was too disjointed, which I realize is kind of the point, but it didn't make for an enjoyable reading experience and I could only bring myself to read a chapter or two at a time. I'll give it 2.5 stars based on the parts I liked and the obvious writing skill on display, rounded up to 3."
If on a Winter s Night a Traveler,4,"June 26, 2023","Post-modern masterpiece by Calvino, who takes his place alongside Nabokov and Faulkner. Through a succession of bait'n'switch narratives, interrupted by inquisitive musings on the literary experience, Calvino creates a page-turning puzzle on book culture, from the mise-en-page to the writer-reader relationship. The book's playful deconstructionism climaxes in a Kafkaesque adventure, cleverly predicated on cryptic clues embedded throughout the larger narrative. For discriminating readers only."
Slaughterhouse Five,3,"September 10, 2020",Okay I just finished Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut and I am not fully sure what to make of this. I feel like I got a lot of new thinking points and perspectives that are inspiring. But I personally do not enjoy the writing style. This kind of telegraphic sentences are not for my kafkaesque mind. I think I might read it again and see if I will appreciate it more.
Slaughterhouse Five,1,"May 19, 2019",Not impressed with this best-seller. Too Kafkaesque for my liking. Not recommended.
Slaughterhouse Five,2,"October 14, 2014","Well, let me make one thing clear right at the outset: ‘Slaughterhouse 5’ is definitely not a science fiction novel. This novel is more like an absurdist story where reality and fantasy seem to merge; this is an attempt at a Kafkaesque narrative, albeit without Kafka’s characteristic grim tone and bitterness."
Slaughterhouse Five,5,"September 5, 2013","Billy Pilgrim's Kafkaesque gift for understatement and depressive ennui make this a work of genius just as much as it can easily put off its audience. It's almost impossible to like this guy, but if you can hang in long enough to let Vonnegut show you what (or what doesn't) make him tick, this can turn into a compelling postmodernist read."
lapvona,4,"December 15, 2022","I loved this book, it has this absurdist kafkaesque quality that just makes it such a pleasurable read. At the same time it handles everyday life in such a brutal way, at points it was unbareable to continue reading because you just don't know how to react to the information you just received. It handles many characters which all have a human-ness to them which i very much appreciate, normally the types of book set in this era infantalize women whilst the women in this book are agentic BUT their societal situation is what hinders them from expressing that agency freely. Instead it comes in snippets from one of the many characters in which we get to understand from a firsthand perspective."
lapvona,4,"July 20, 2022","This novel is highly reminiscent of Kafka's The Castle, except instead of an impenetrable, non-responsive bureaucracy, the citizens of Lapvona must contend with a remote, non-responsive buffoonish lord who does not value the lives of the people around him and refuses to share his prodigious wealth, even when the village is in crisis. I.e., it is a Kafkaesque story fitting for our age."
rouge,2,"April 22, 2024","I’m not going to lie a big part of the reason I bought the book was because the cover art was intriguing. The story I thought would be too and a first glance it is. It had all the potential, a secret cult, surrealness , great imagery and timely themes of the toxicity of the beauty industry and mother daughter relationships. But it got soooo repetitive and I felt like it took forever for anything to actually happen that by the time it did I didn’t really care. I think this story would have been better served as a novella, it is very kafkaesque. Best part of the story was the little momma jellyfish and the bigger jellyfish and all the lead up to that could have been cut by 200 pages."
rouge,4,"November 1, 2023","This was an absolute fever dream. The author explores the toxic nature of the beauty industry and the glamorizing of whiteness through a bizarre, kafkaesque fairy tale metaphor. It was a dark twist on Snow White (mirror, mirror, on the wall) with some disorienting, trippy magical realism. It was equal parts funny, insightful, and confusing as hell. I will never look at Tom Cruise the same way again- IYKYK."
How to Defend Yourself Against Scorpions ,5,"June 27, 2017","Sismondi acts but he is then immediately summoned to the city’s police headquarters. What follows will remind a reader of Franz Kafka, such tales as Before the Law, The Trial and The Castle. However, this is not Kafka, this is Fernando Sorrentino - thus we have a Kafkaesque nightmare with an absurdist curveball thrown in at the very end. Thank you, Fernando. An unforgettable literary lollapalooza."
piranesi,3,"October 7, 2020","Piranesi is inspired by the works of Jorge Luis Borges, in particular, The Library of Babel and by the surreal, atmospheric prints of Italian artist Giovanni Batista Piranesi, Imaginary Prisons. However, Clarke's take on this is neither dry and philosophical, nor oppressive and Kafkaesque, but rather take the form of a light-hearted mystery."
piranesi,5,"October 8, 2020","Set in a dreamlike, Kafkaesque world with a house of infinite halls, each lined with an army of awe-inspiring statues in multifarious shapes and sizes, the thunder of the rain amidst the heavy clouds on the floor above and the incessant crashing of the tidal waves of an entire ocean in the floor below. It’s only inhabitants - the fish, the birds, skeletal remains of presumably previous inhabitants, the enigmatic Other and the eponymous protagonist, Piranesi."
piranesi,3,"May 23, 2021","I love the premise; not sure about the execution. It was an interesting journey but I found the destination a bit underwhelming and perhaps too allegorical, kafkaesque but lighter in tone. On the bright side, I enjoyed as a reader the inevitable speculation of what the story would actually be about, and I think it is unravelled in a beautiful way. I appreciate that Clarke tried to do something entirely different from her previous novel, and I respect her as an artist; I feel I will always trust her in her future works, in the same way I'll die a faithful Donna-Tarttist, whose first novel was also one of my obsessions. Despite the fact I could not identify with the characters in this one, not even with Piranesi, still Susanne Clarke I feel as kindred spirit; passages like the one bellow made that clear to me:"
piranesi,5,"November 6, 2021","While Clarke’s book is not a biography about the actual historical figure in any form, the additional background adds some context to the choice of the name Piranesi; the atmospheric imagery from his circa 1745 etchings (“Le Carceri d'invenzione”) are reflected often in the novel, but less mechanical and Kafkaesque, and more earthly and ancient—statues, tides, birds, hallways, the suggestion of magic. One can’t help but sense that some familiarity with these works helps “pull back a curtain” and sheds some light on the world &amp; story that Clarke has built."
piranesi,5,"October 5, 2020","A very Kafkaesque story, Piranesi lives in the house. Perhaps he always has."
piranesi,4,"August 6, 2024","Don't tell me it's not fantastical at all, just some kafkaesque daydream or schizophrenic hallucination."
piranesi,4,"January 26, 2025","This was the 4th book of our book club. All participants enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed the 1st third where I was intrigued by the mystery of what the house, its halls and persons in it represented. Personally I would have preferred, if the author had skipped the 2nd third (I didn't appreciate the dynamics with the other and the slow unveiling of the ""truth"" of the labyrinth) and in a Kafkaesque turn of phrase had gone straight to the last third, which ends the story on a note that is both modern (about mental health) while allowing for magic and uncertainties."
piranesi,5,"December 23, 2020","Kafkaesque, I think."
Alice s Adventures in Wonderland Through the Looking Glass,3,"May 2, 2017",The Kafkaesque movement and morphing of beings from baby to pig hallway to river allowed others to see and write in ways that perhaps wouldn't exist if it weren't for Carroll. (Maybe the word should be Carrollesque after all...)
The Bonfire of the Vanities,5,"June 3, 2023","An incident in the Bronx sucks all three into the Kafkaesque meat grinder at the nexus of the American courts, press, and politics. If this novel is about anything at all, perhaps it’s a social commentary on how little justice has anything to do with the media circus we call the American criminal justice system. As Wolfe writes, a liberal is a conservative who’s been arrested."
The Bonfire of the Vanities,3,"July 27, 2018","A good multi-viewpoint tale of New York life. Sadly its not as good as I'd expected though. It's essentially a carnival of grotesques (excepting the Lambs and Campbell), where the satisfaction of seeing a ""Master of the Universe"" brought low is tempered by the various ways in which the other characters are unattractive. Indeed, it becomes a kafkaesque nightmare where you actually start feeling sorry for the central character, trapped in a web of lies which make his situation ever worse. A proper ending would've helped but no there is to be no release from this trial."
The Bonfire of the Vanities,4,"December 22, 2021","Trying to branch out into reading literary fiction lately and I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It is surprisingly relevant today, despite being nearly 35 years old now. It's interesting that almost no one is a sympathetic character in this book, and yet I didn't hate it like I hate most books where every character is an asshole. One might imagine that this is because I reveled in Sherman the arrogant asshole being plunged into a kafkaesque nightmare, but in a lot of ways Sherman is one of the more sympathetic characters in the book — he's remorseful and generally wants to do the right thing and bumbles around because he doesn't really know how to play the game."
The End of the Affair,4,"February 28, 2020","This is a really odd novel. Noir, kafkaesque and yet quite ordinary. A man torn between love and hate towards his lover and the world. The lover, torn between fate and agnosticism, her husband - never providing her the affection she needs (maybe he was gay?) and yet loving her deeply, the odd minster of atheism and rationality, the odd private eye with his child boy sidekick... and death looming over everything."
the investigation,5,"April 23, 2023",The term Kafkaesque is overused and abused (as is the term Surrealist) however it's deserved in this case.
the investigation,4,"February 17, 2012","This epigraph of Philippe Claudel's L'Enquête (""The Investigation"") - ""Pour les prochains, afin qu'ils ne soient pas les suivants"" - is an intriguing play on words in French that may be adequately be translated with ""For those who come after us so that they won't be[come] followers"". *) With his recent, extraordinarily thought provoking and disturbing novel Claudel takes the reader on an investigative journey into the depths of existentialist probing: What comprises an individual? How much are we each ourselves and how much a product of circumstances, subject to external forces that we do not, or possibly cannot, control? Alternatively, is it possible and up to us to act independently from the norm, to overcome complacency and rebel against acceptance of external control and manipulation? And, if we attempt to swim against the stream... will it change anything for us and the society we are part of? In Kafkaesque nightmarish scenarios that remind me also of H.G. Wells, Orwell and, at different times, of science fiction worlds, or of images of early Soviet Socialist realistic art and writings, Claudel explores fundamental questions of individuality, self-awareness in the face of overwhelming trends towards conformity and willing acceptance of external power structures."
the investigation,3,"March 23, 2023","A somewhat lackluster attempt at being Kafkaesque married to a most disappointing ending. Not for everyone, certainly wasn't for me"
the investigation,3,"July 3, 2012","Kafkaesque. It's one of a handful of literary terms that is really overworked. But I challenge anyone to read Phillipe Claudel's 
  The Investigation
 without that word coming to mind. Ultimately, though, Claudel adds a surrealistic resolution that may baffle readers."
the investigation,Not rated,"June 11, 2014","Most discussions of Philippe Claudel’s fiction eventually identify Kafka as a likely influence, some even describing his narratives as “Kafkaesque.” If anything, The Investigation, the most recent of Claudel’s books to be translated into English, makes it unmistakably clear that such comparisons are entirely accurate, but it might also prompt us to consider the implications of the comparison more carefully. Kafka’s undeniable greatness aside, why, after almost 100 years, would a novel that so obviously duplicates the most familiar features of the Kafkaesque, that so obviously wants to be Kafkaesque, also still want to be regarded as somehow original and daring?"
the investigation,3,"September 21, 2012","The jacket flap describes this as Kafkaesque. Coincidently, my husband is reading ""The Trial"" right now, and when he described it to me it did sound absurd in the same way this novel is absurd. So there you go, the book is Kafkaesque -- one of those adjectives that sounds impressive whether you liked the book or not."
the investigation,5,"February 18, 2013","This book is a delightful (can you say that about something so Kafkaesque?) mash-up of absurdism and postmodernism that I found engrossing from beginning to end. It is ostensibly the story of the Investigator, who is sent to the City to investigate a series of suicides at the Enterprise. (Correct: there are no names in this novel; the characters are identified by the functions they fulfill.) From the moment the Investigator arrives, however, nothing goes right. There is no car to meet him at the train station and no taxi available. By the time he finally makes it to the Enterprise on foot, it is late the the Guard, convinced he is the Downsizer rather than the Investigator, won't let him in. And the novel moves on from there, though a series of frustratingly absurd incidents. Nothing goes as expected for the Investigator and his Investigation never actually manages to get going."
the investigation,3,"July 21, 2012","It is impossible to describe The Investigator without the word Kafkaesque. In fact Kafka with mobile phones might be the most apt description. It is about the Investigator who arrives in an unnamed town to investigate the Enterprise and is thwarted by the Policeman, the Guide, the Manager, and other sundry characters or character types, with the entire novel in the end dissolving into something between postmodernism and hallucination."
the investigation,3,"March 17, 2014","Totally Kafkaesque. I have not read Kafka for a very long time, I used to love his books, maybe I would not enjoy them anymore, I'd have to read one again to figure out. But I know that I did not really like ""L'enquête"" (I read it in French). Fortunately it's a short book, because it seems repetitive, and even a little boring. I realize there are interesting subjects in this book: the place of rules, technology, hierarchy in society, what makes us humans and lose our humanity. But still, I just could not get into that book, after having read about a third of it, I was ready to move on. The author does a good job at transcribing the absurdity of it all in his tone and his writing though."
the investigation,2,"August 26, 2012","If you decide to read this book, think of it as a quick read of a Kafkaesque novella so you are not disappointed. This work is not of the intense and mesmerizing caliber of Grey Souls with its beautiful descriptions and deep character development. There are, however, some amusingly absurd moments during The Inspector's attempts to investigate the Enterprise, his stay at ""The Hope"" hotel, and his circular discussions with the Giantess and the Policeman. It's worth reading to the end for his speculations about life as he talks with the Psychologist and the Founder. Claudel, being the Director, should make a short film. But it's not a profound novel like Grey Souls or Brodeck."
the investigation,3,"November 13, 2013","Claudel had clearly boned up on his idealist and existential philosophers before diving into this one. Unfortunately, his philosophical conceits are a bit hamfisted, and there's not a lot of surprise to be had. That said, it nipped along at a quick pace and kept me curious, even if it did beat me over the head with Kafkaesque absurdity and Kantian musings."
The Hearing Trumpet,4,"August 6, 2022","The word Kafkaesque gets thrown around a little too liberally for my tastes, maybe because it describes a perception of mood than a writing style, and the mood descriptor is quite tainted with false impressions. I like Kafkaesque more as a descriptor of a writing style that is surprising in its logic, absurd but not inaccessible. Kafka's stories feel in a way that they're trying to figure themselves out as we read them (and perhaps that was the case at times with the writer) but there is still a confidence that the extremity of reason we experience has some basis, possibly in social commentary, but also to show us how extreme the world of the fiction can be."
wedding preparations in the country,2,"March 23, 2022","even tho “incomplete” is part of the whole kafka thing, this one felt too disjointed and slow for my liking. But, the interesting Kafkaesque theme of non-arrival is here, and there’s good prose in here too (and tbf he wasn’t proud of this one)"
Fly on the Wall,2,"January 22, 2019","I picked this book up because I generally enjoy E. Lockhart's work, and I appreciated the Kafkaesque premise, but I was sorely disappointed by the lack of... everything else. The side characters are rather flimsy caricatures, the plot is essentially tensionless, Gretchen's arc is a bit too quick and easy, there's no explanation of the speculative elements—I could go on, but you get the picture. Young Adult was a different landscape 13 years ago, and it shows. (Note: Did anyone really call penises ""gherkins"" and boobs ""biscuits"" back then, or are we supposed to read that as Gretchen being quirky...?)"
Fly on the Wall,3,"August 16, 2022","Gretchen Yee wishes she were a fly on the wall and wakes up in a Kafkaesque moment. Gretchen is obsessed with Titus but he's one of the Art Rats and she isn't. Gretchen feels very out of place in school and lets it come out with snarky comments and a false brave face on. She goes to a school for gifted artistic types, the Manhattan HS for the Arts but doesn't feel like she belongs. She only draws spiderman and comic types. The teachers want her to branch out but she doesn't know how. She's also confused about boys and what they think, what are they really like. When she gets the opportunity to find out it's kind of freaky. But knowing leads to understanding."
Fly on the Wall,4,"May 3, 2020",Surprisingly good. Easy read.Wished the Bully wouldn't have get by with with his behaviour - but that's making the book a tad more realistic. As far as a Kafkaesque girl-turns-to-insect- story is getting realistic that is..
Fly on the Wall,4,"February 13, 2015","The premise of the book is interesting: a girl who is very curious to have a better understanding of the male psyche somehow gets her wish in a Kafkaesque manner: she turns into a fly, trapped in the boys' locker room. E. Lockhart is a great writer (funny, too!), she has the ability that I prize most in writing: her dialogue never comes out hokey, I am never, even for a second, removed from the atmosphere of the book because something didn't ring true, in a ""I have never heard someone speak like that"" way*."
Fly on the Wall,5,"November 6, 2008",Very interesting. Kafkaesque. I can't imagine getting a fly's eye view of a high school boy's locker room. I had to do a bio-bibliography on this author and have loved both of the books I have read by her so far. Can't wait to read the rest of them and hope she keeps writing. She also writes children's books and has written adult books under her real name Emily Jenkins.
Fly on the Wall,2,"May 21, 2013","This was a quick read and entertaining. The plot twist is very Kafkaesque, but I found the main character very genuine. The time in the locker room felt to drawn out for me, however, and I had wished the author had her drawing more in the end to tie the loose ends together. I would recommend this book for some teen girls that like ""snarky"" humor and an intelligent female protagonist."
Fly on the Wall,2,"September 22, 2012","Hmmm, ""Kafkaesque"" is one way to put it. The middle part was really strange, even though I could somewhat suspend disbelief. Still, I like the author's other books much better. I did enjoy the narration of the audio version though."
The Fall,5,"November 5, 2023",An interesting account of a troubled person. A one sided essay with a single perspective but deeming the understanding of his character. Camus style expressed in a kafkaesque way. Beautiful writing as always thank you again Camus for a pleasant conversation.
The Fall,5,"February 5, 2017","After reading this book, I was sure that Albert Camus was inspired by Franz Kafka. The Fall is a confession of the man called Jean-Baptiste Clamence. It’s not just the acknowledgment of the crimes we come across our prosaic life, but these are the crimes which are self contradictory in nature. The line of reasoning used to represent morality in this book, can be best described by the word Kafkaesque."
Doomsday Book,5,"May 19, 2016","The author concentrates on the small stories amid the greater crises. These are acute observations of individual's peculiarities. The man obsessed that the toilet paper would run out, the women determined to get to their concert, the academic rivalries, the Kafkaesque nightmare of dealing with a bureaucracy at Christmas when everyone's on holiday. These stories are sometimes amusing, sometimes sad, always perfectly realised."
death valley,3,"May 25, 2024","Three and a half stars! It is a wonderful story, and I love the purposeful weirdness that isn't quite kafkaesque. The character is so relatable too. Unfortunately, there's only so many brackets I can deal with (despite the fact that I understand why Melissa used them)."
Rash mon and Seventeen Other Stories,3,"December 27, 2015","W/r/t the stories, they are really good. I'd even say he's Japan's Chekhov. In fact, you could see an exotic blend of Kafka, Gogol, Chekhov, and even Dostoevsky at work behind these stories. My personal favorites are his famous ""Hell Screen"" (intense and just awesome), ""In the Bamboo Grove"" (Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on this), and ""Horse legs"" (which is very Kafkaesque and just funny). ""Loyalty"" is also excellent in terms of it psychological insights. Though I wasn't a big fan of his later, autobiographical stories, they were strangely engaging. It's just too bad that one of his most famous stories, ""Kappa,"" is not included in this collection. Overall, it's a good short anthology of Akutagawa's stories."
Rash mon and Seventeen Other Stories,4,"October 16, 2017","In the second segment, titled Under the Sword, we move forward in time to the early seventeenth century. Its three stories include the Christian martyrdom-themed O-Gin. The third part, Modern Tragicomedy, consists of three Kafkaesque fables. In one a company employee acquires horse legs, much to his chagrin. The final portion is autobiographical in nature. It provides insights into the background and tortured psyche of arguably Japan’s most famous literary exponent."
Rash mon and Seventeen Other Stories,4,"July 27, 2007","Unnerving and often quite funny, these stories are occasionally Kafkaesque but always quite penetrating of life in Japan in the early 20th century."
Rash mon and Seventeen Other Stories,3,"February 23, 2024",Some of Akutagawa’s short stories feel Kafkaesque like “Hell Scene” or “Rashomon”. The first half are various and interesting but second half were autobiographical in nature. Although those who are interested in turn of the century Japan might like the latter stories.
The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays,5,"February 18, 2015","To say that this was a shot in the arm is a profound understatement. I'm currently stuck in my home town, waiting to hear back from grad schools while chipping away at a student loan. For the last few months, my life in this city has felt like a Kafkaesque hell. The Myth of Sisyphus has helped me to power through with a smile on my face, and to strip away my preconceived narratives of where I should be at this point in my life."
Dream Story,Not rated,"February 18, 2024","In Fräulein Else, the 19-year-old Else travels to San Martino di Castrozza in order to convince a art dealer to lend money to pay her father's debt. The landscape of the Alps, previously only a mere background to the unfolding of the story, becomes the exterior sensory representation of Elsa's inner movements. If more and more, during her frantic stream of consciousness, her rhetoric becomes a means of justifying her own actions, e.g. to take or not take the pills, to descend the hotel stairs completely naked etc., then nature will also take the stage of her inner revolutions as the inaugural place of her rebirth. She dreams of dying and wishing to be buried in the silent forests next to the hotel, or of dying somewhere unreachable in the Alps. The heavens assume the identity of the infinite, the night as eternal silence, the longing for a new beginning beyond all words and logical discourse. Else's anarchic desire can be seen as an aggressive and desperate reaction against the symbolic order that her father represents. He does not appear a single time during the novella, perhaps fulfilling Schnitzler's objective of preserving in this story the figure, or order, of the freudian Unconscious in the patriarchal order, which always exists au-delà, beyond the mundane events of the plot, as cause and rule of everything that happens, like the Law in Kafka. As in Kafka, here there are no longer reasons for guilt, but rather the abrupt ""imprisonment"" of Else in the Alps, just as Josef K. is also abruptly and without any reason taken to jail. In the rhetoric era there are no longer reasons, and it would even be impertinent to consider the existence of reasons. What there is, is only discourse, the rhetoric that is so well used by her father and uncle, both lawyers, who use this instrument to free indebted thieves. It would also be interesting to consider this mechanism of eternal renewal, or feedback, in which her father gets in debt in games, earns money in cases of indebted thieves, and gets in debt again. We talked about the Law and the kafkaesque Organization, but we can also talk about this immense structure in Schnitzler, symbolized by the patriarchal order, as also being part of the freudian unheimlich. Else repeats the same sentences, even the same words, of her parents’s reasons, but it is in this neurotic repetition that what once belonged to the natural order of all that is familiar and open, that is to say, to the order of heimlichkeit, becomes unheimlich, strange and closed, equivocal in its supposed truths."
Gravity s Rainbow,5,"March 23, 2015","The book is also heavily invested in ideas of Elect and Preterite, the chosen and the damned. The Elect are the people in authority, referred to throughout the book as They and exist in opposition with the Us['s] and We['s]. They are the force behind the formation of the Raketen-Stadt... or are they? Paranoia is another huge factor in the novel, which is one of the popular readings of the novel. Aptly put, the novel is Kafkaesque; its narratives wind through extensive labyrinths of ideas, negotiating through twists and turns always progressing towards the unknown. This labyrinthine structure contributes vastly to an oppressive sense of anxiety that is constant throughout the book."
The Secret History,5,"November 20, 2024","The way Richard is swept into a chain of events that seem absurd almost feels Kafkaesque. But unlike Kafka’s characters, who are usually overwhelmed by anxiety or helpless dread, Richard approaches the murder with an unsettling calm and rationalisation."
Love and Garbage,4,"May 6, 2025","What is it about love that consumes and exhausts? And how does emptiness masquerade as yearning for another life, or another person? When Ivan Klíma writes about the ""suppressed voice of the soul"" it is so Kafkaesque, with dreamlike scenes, inner revelations, and disparate elements that can at times baffle when they appear unexpectedly. These are the streets of Prague the writer-protagonist cleans, and so it comes as no surprise that he also writes about Kafka and the loneliness that shrouded the artist. It is also no surprise that Klíma, a widely translated Czech author, won the coveted Franz Kafka Prize in 2000."
Love and Garbage,4,"January 28, 2016","This novel is partly a meditation on the vagaries of love, or rather being in a situation where you have two relationships and are unable or unwilling to choose between them. But Ivan Klima, in his beautiful novel provides much more: an analysis and meditation on the need to remember the events in our life and, for this writer, the need to write about them, recording the existence so that the memories are not lost. He provides a running commentary from the narrator on the thoughts and writings of Franz Kafka. Filled with autobiographical references, the novel engages the reader in the meaning of loving and living, of communication with others when you are living in a world that borders on the ""Kafkaesque"". Diverse scenes with his coworkers, his wife and mistress, even his dying father resonate with the reader and coalesce to form a vivid picture of his world. That he succeeds in all of this is a tribute to the genius of Klima and the spirit that he exhibits in the telling."
Love and Garbage,5,"July 17, 2023","czech writers (or at least the famous ones) have such a distinct voice — something mundane yet surrealist (ie quintessentially kafkaesque, yes) and i'm so here for it"
The Tartar Steppe,3,"February 23, 2021","This novel has a light Kafkaesque undertone, a beautiful staging and a few hallucinatory passages. Of course, the parallel with Beckett's Waiting for Godot is very obvious. Drogo's life is tragic and universal, you can't but have sympathy for the fate of this little man. It was really gorgeous to read this in Italian."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"June 16, 2024","Translated by Stuart C. Hood from Dino Buzzati's Il deserto dei Tartari, published in 1940, I came to this fascinating novel via Javier Cercas's Lord of All the Dead, translated by Anne McLeanThe&nbsp;Tartar Steppe&nbsp;is an extraordinary novel by Dino Buzatti. It is a slightly Kafkaesque fable in which a young lieutenant called Giovanni Drogo is posted to a remote fortress ... Thirsting for glory and battles, Drogo waits in vain for the arrival of the Tartars, and his whole life is spent waiting. I've often thought that this hopeless fable is an emblem of the fates of many of those who packed their bags.Slightly Kafkaesque sums it up perfectly, as it contains the allegorical elements of Kafka's work, and elements of bureaucracy gone mad - Drogo is immediately unimpressed with his obscure posting and is told he can leave very shortly, just once certain documentation takes place, but it never seems to happen. But there is a much stronger sense here of melancholy, of hope frustrated over the decades the book spans, of a sense of waiting for something, of the cycle of life."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"February 10, 2020","A fabulous little novel exploring Kafkaesque motifs. The voice of the protagonist very authentic. Reminds me of a quote from Coetzee: ""Sleep is no longer a healing bath, a recuperation of vital forces, but an oblivion, a nightly brush with annihilation."""
The Tartar Steppe,4,"December 12, 2023","Calling a novel ""Kafkaesque"" is fraught with peril, since only Kafka can be Kafka. Yet this novel approaches that standard. There is the same sense of unease and dread, as though we are caught in an absurd dream which will never end: yet the story has a logical thread and does not slip down into total absurdity as it does with Kafka. The reader feels that the author is telling you something profound - but what? That we can never put our finger on. The central theme, one feels, continuously slips away."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"March 3, 2022","The book is a curious (kafkaesque) look at the repetitive nature of existence, at the wasted years we throw away on working in jobs we hate, at the wasted youth we cannot hold onto, at the desperate search we have for a purpose, a meaning. To find something that will distract us from the ticking of the clock. But in truth, no matter what we do, we waste our lives. Because what purpose is there? Marriage? Children? Being a success? All things designated by others as symbols of a successful life. But what difference does it really make?"
The Tartar Steppe,5,"September 6, 2021","The Tartar Steppe may just be a tad too quiet and aimless, and there is this impression that Buzzati might have tried different scenarios in his story and was not altogether sure which one would work so he included them all. Still, the author conjured up one uncanny world in his book, and the story, coupled with its bleak, but poignant ending, becomes deeply contemplative, Kafkaesque and unforgettable."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"June 23, 2022","Dino Buzzati had mixed feelings about being acclaimed as ""the Italian Kafka"" when this novel was first published in 1940. The novel's setting, a desolate frontier fortress where young officers come and are somehow unable ever to leave, is certainly Kafkaesque. As the story develops, however, the auctorial tone diverges somewhat from Kafka's: the irony is softer and subtler, the details less stylized and more mundane. In the night, sweet dream sequences pass through the main character's sleeping mind, leavening the sense of desperation while leaving the predicament unchanged. The narrative becomes more reminiscent of Hesse than Kafka, the story of a life that has missed its mark (as whose life doesn't, one way or other?). Upon conclusion, the book left a feeling similar to having just savored the final phrases of an inspired and well-executed concert piece."
The Tartar Steppe,5,"May 20, 2012","The Tartar Steppe is a Kafkaesque masterpiece with passages of pure, floating ‘poetry’. The symbiosis of fantastic elements with realistic ones is a reminiscence of ballads. There exists no desert in any area of the Italian border. There exists no Bastianni Fortress that protects the country from any incursion. And yet the whole work is built on allegory and symbols of the desert and fortress."
The Tartar Steppe,3,"August 10, 2024",Book recommended to me by (another) French boy. Aside from unexpectedly forcing me to learn military grades of rank this book acheived what it set out to acheive. The body of the book had its grating kafkaesque monotony which made Drogo's death disturb and shock me despite its predictability. I am duly affected and will probably recall this book more often than is pleasant.
The Tartar Steppe,3,"August 16, 2016","There are very few book descriptions that strike more fear in my heart than ""Kafkaesque."" Despite the comparison to one of my most disliked authors, I actually did like Dino Buzzati's ""The Tartar Steppe."""
The Tartar Steppe,4,"December 22, 2017","With the premise of ""Waiting for Barbarians"" of J.M. Coetzee, Kafkaesque atmosphere, ""Waiting for Godot"" mood and slight philosophical touch of Camus this book became an instant hook for me from the very beginning. This piece about settling down, about hope and the irreversibly of time and choices kept me awake for two nights as I really wanted to see what comes next. Definitely a must read for almost everyone, as it will give you food to contemplate on your own life and choices you make."
The Tartar Steppe,1,"July 12, 2025","This book should have worked perfectly for me on paper, considering that I ADORE kafkaesque, surreal and existential books. The problem is, the writing is completely dry. Nothing endears me, nothing moves me. I don’t like books that are just bleak with no other emotion explored."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"May 4, 2025","Kafkaesque, pensive, I found the book quite moving."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"September 24, 2023","On a final note, this book was chosen for this month's book club category, magical realism. By today's standards, I don't think it belongs in that category, but the setting and characters' behaviors all seem a bit ""off,"" which is, I suppose, why it is considered one of ""the forerunners in the genre."" I also detected strong Kafkaesque and absurdist elements: Drogo's inability to take action in his own life, an ominous depiction of the monotony of life at the fort, and Drogo's existential worries."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"July 14, 2024","Kafkaesque, unique, recommended."
The Tartar Steppe,5,"January 24, 2025","truly haunting and thought-provoking story that stays in the back of your mind. Subtle kafkaesque style that goes by seamingly unnoticed and then you don't realise when, but it moves you deeply - isn't that similiar to life? Metaphores... The motif of endless, maddening waiting, hope and life being slowly lost is overwhelming as well as the constant inaccesibility. Similiarly to The Trial and The Castle it's open to interpretations, highly personal and beautiful in the end. Must read"
The Tartar Steppe,4,"December 3, 2023","Excellent; prose that is both warmly colorful and coolly precise, like the geometric modernism of his contemporaries in the visual arts; to call the novel Kafkaesque would be to diminish Buzzati's art, not because the comparison to Kafka is itself misguided, but because the relationship between Buzzati and Kafka is one of kinship."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"September 27, 2024","An excellent, Kafkaesque, book, only slightly tarnished by its almost romantic ending. The book reminded of several Russian novels, in particular Platonov’s lonely absurdist novels, Soul and The Foundation Pit."
The Tartar Steppe,Not rated,"May 20, 2025","I don't think it deserves to be called Kafkaesque as it often is. Its absurdism is almost purely tragic, not comic, concluding in one last bit of self-deception even in the face of death. It is, though, a very apt allegory."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"June 17, 2023","There were some weird issues I had with this, like characters who pop up without having been mentioned before but it’s a strange, Kafkaesque book so it doesn’t matter much. The sense of guarding something that doesn’t really need guarding is very poignant. As is the idea of eventually having a chance to be a protector to that thing but being too old and sickly by then."
The Tartar Steppe,5,"August 7, 2018","A nightmare told tenderly. As far as plot goes, Buzzati has no mercy on his protagonist, Drogo, and subjects him to the cruelest of existential tortures: a wasted life—a life wasted consciously, even, in thrall to the teasing hope of military glory. The situation is Kafkaesque: soldiers wait on an outpost for an attack that always seems just around the corner yet never comes. Buzzati drives the plot adroitly, managing to make stagnancy compelling, even suspenseful, long after the reader has caught onto his game (that's why this is no spoiler, really)."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"March 29, 2022","According to Tim Parks in the introduction, we're not allowed to call this writer Kafkaesque, because that analysis has been overdone. Unfortunately, I didn't read Tim's words until after I'd read the book (who reads an introduction first, with all its spoilers? Why don't publishers do what they do in Germany and put the introduction as an Afterword at the end?), so all the time I was reading 'The Tartar Steppe' (Buzzati's original title - 'The Fort') I was thinking how... Kafkaesque this book is. Not that this is a bad thing - it's a fine piece of writing, even if the protagonist has the personality of a... career military man who doesn't really make a career out of being a military man. He goes nowhere, literally. Like so many of us. And although you might scream at him to get off his arse, you know that, on the majority of your days, you're not much different, whatever you like to think. That's why we are where we are."
The Tartar Steppe,4,"February 2, 2024","Giovanni Drogo is posted to a far from everywhere fort, and has every intention of returning to the city as quickly as possible. There seems to be nothing preventing his leaving the outpost and yet, he is still there some years later. The Tartar Steppe is often seen as critique of the military. Maybe, but I saw it more generally as a parable about how society draws us in and sucks us down somehow, and how we end up in a Kafkaesque world unable to find our way out. Enjoyed it, but I find these allegory like stories less interesting these days."
The Tartar Steppe,5,"August 4, 2023",A superb Kafkaesque meditation on the meaning of work and duty.
Replay,4,"August 7, 2011","Very engrossing book - cool central idea that at first seems like everyone's fantasy, then becomes a Kafkaesque trap - ending with a sort of peaceful acceptance of life as it is lived...a place we all will arrive at sometime - I hope"
Wise Blood,5,"February 23, 2020",Flannery is so gory and kafkaesque I really cannot understand she is so widely accepted by catholic America ?! Her stories are chock-full of allegories which can be interpreted in many ways off course ;)
Wise Blood,4,"March 2, 2017","Pretty fantastic. Well composed short little book here. Great characters, interesting story, good writing. The ending really sealed the deal for me. The description on the back described this as Kafkaesque. I disagree. I think something like The Cannibal is far closer to Kafka than this. However, I'm not sure what I would describe this as. Perhaps in a league of its own. Hazel Motes, you're one interesting character."
Wise Blood,3,"April 28, 2024","I enjoyed this novel, certainly more than I thought I would. This is a very funny book, and often in a cruel sort of way. The plot develops in such an absurd fashion; not in a wholly surreal, Kafkaesque way, but the characters and events are tuned to a frequency of hysteria that never truly relaxes. Nothing and nobody is plain, normal, or beautiful in the world O'Connor wrote."
Wise Blood,3,"October 11, 2019","The overall tone was a bit surreal (almost kafkaesque, but not quite that weird), and the plot felt like it was cobbled together from unconnected stories. A little investigation afterward turned up the fact that this is in fact multiple independent short stories smooshed into a single “novel.” Overall, some of the images and plot points were memorable, but it felt like a strange hodge-podge to me."
Wise Blood,Not rated,"December 17, 2012","Flannery O'Connor is perhaps one of the greatest American short story writers and so I had high hopes coming into this book. Unfortunately, in this novel, her grounded, dirty, every day people are thrown into a comical, absurd situation and it just doesn't sit. Despite familiar types of characters in a Kafkaesque situation, the absurdity of it all seems imposed. The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes moving novel that can't seem to find its footing. It's a shame because I think this book realy does a number of things well, such as the struggle of Hazel, our protagonist against the things that he has seen and done and the ways that he manifests that struggle."
The Complete Maus,5,"April 24, 2021","In those days, Hollywood was producing some of its most celebrated films, and Mickey Mouse was quickly becoming the cutest little mascot on the silver screen. At that very same moment, the Allied troops carried movie cameras into the concentration camps. The films that remain from that time —the ones shown during the Nuremberg trial — are tough to watch, haunting, almost impossible to put into words. Art Spiegelman has managed to blend both pictures (Disney and the Red Army file footage) poetically, through flat, condensed and straightforward drawings. His old father, a bit soft in the head and speaking in a funny broken English, provides a deeply personal, honest, at times slightly Kafkaesque or Chaplinesque account of these dreadful years, of that constant fear and deprivation, such that we could make some sense of this inhuman, world-changing experience."
The Complete Maus,5,"May 4, 2016","While recounting his father's life and how he collected this information, Spiegelman shows us another difficult subject - his mother's fight with depression and ultimate loss by suicide, and the repercussions this had on their family. These are the only pages drawn in a more realistic style but also surreal (Kafkaesque even), and so poignant. Spiegelman also suffered depression and this could explain how this section was so fully charged, in contrast with his father's experiences, which are presented in a more dispassionate fashion."
The Catcher in the Rye,5,"March 21, 2020","Each’s journey largely intersects with one important, glaring caveat: Siddhartha is shielded from suffering and leaves comfort to immerse himself in it. Holden is cast out from witnessing too much of it, only to uncover a more pathetic version of reality. The quick to slight cab-drivers, the “ugly” women from Seattle, the hooker, the nuns, “queen of phonies” Sally Hayes, Old Luce, the vet looking for his initials in the stalls (memory), even freaking Mr. Antolini, are all just pathetic reflections of reality. It’s almost Kafkaesque, except the characters talking around the protagonist, they just talk over him."
South of the Border West of the Sun,4,"October 13, 2019","He loves a good sex scene does Murakami, and they can be found here also, but at least here his eroticism feels like it's in the right place and at the right time, and not crawling out of the woodwork at the oddest of moments like he has done before. He leaves his Kafkaesque side behind here, with no strange happenings or talking cats, but there are other Murakami trademarks like whisky and jazz that feel right at home."
South of the Border West of the Sun,5,"December 27, 2021","further, kafka on the shore’s 15 year old Kafka Tamura, a young boy who escapes his life only to tumble into a surrealist rabbit hole which amplifies Murakami’s previous magical realism undertones to the max, however also amplifies the more than likely unnecessary sexual motifs that form one of two aspects of Murakami’s books which i dislike, the other of which being the kafkaesque turmoil which is frequently and consistently present in the wind up bird chronicle through the character of Toru Okada- in this case making 600 page book all the more tiresome to get through."
South of the Border West of the Sun,5,"January 22, 2023","Magnifique et bouleversant, Kafkaesque et saisissant."
South of the Border West of the Sun,4,"August 7, 2024","Ambiguity, Kafkaesque"
White Nights,4,"January 18, 2025","White Nights is an excellent melodrama (can see why it's such excellent fodder for filmmakers), Bobok a little kafkaesque rendition of the persistence of human grimness even after death. The prose at the start of the latter - staccato chopped-up ravings - is particularly striking."
White Nights,4,"July 8, 2025",Kafkaesque in the sense that the main character is a simp. But who amongst us hasn’t loved someone who loved someone else a bit more?
horns,5,"July 24, 2014","I HIGHLY recommend this book if you're looking for something different. It's twisted as hell, very Kafkaesque. It's a little horror, a little psychological thriller. A little mystery, a little coming-of-age. It's got something for almost everyone."
horns,5,"June 18, 2024","Brilliant, dark, witty, poignant. A Kafkaesque opener that unfolds to a mystery-revenge tale. Perfectly paced, interestingly structured. The third quarter of the novel might seem a bit longer than a backstory should be, that late in the story, but it’s necessary and well done."
horns,4,"September 4, 2018","(My son says there was a guy who turned into a dung beetle in Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" - haven't read that one - and it's never really explained. So you can legit call Perrish's horns ""Kafkaesque."")"
horns,4,"January 15, 2017","I love finding a new author! Horns starts with Ignatius Perrish waking up in a Kafkaesque fashion—he has sprouted horns overnight. A year ago Ig was on his way to England to start a job. The day was leaving, the love of his life, Merrin, was found raped and murdered, and everyone thinks Ig did it. The evidence at the scene was lost in a fire at the lab, so he has no way to prove that he didn't do it, that his alibi of passing out drunk in his parked car was legit. Ig has been lost during this year only starts to find purpose when his new horns seem to cause everyone he meets to confess to their most horrible sins and their most corrupt thoughts and dreams. In the midst of his disgust, anger, and horror over learning these things, he realizes he can let himself continue changing and developing powers and perhaps find and punish the real killer."
horns,4,"December 9, 2012","'Horns' is a great book that grabbed me from the first page with it's Kafkaesque opening lines, although the repetition during the flashbacks made the book drag slightly. The back story could have been cut down. While reading I could imagine it as a film, after finishing I discovered it actually will be... but starring Daniel Radcliffe, which is a total disappointment. Joe hill, like his father, knows how to write good characters and engaging with them and discovering their pasts is what I enjoyed most, so having the wooden Daniel Radcliffe play a well written, involving character is a shame. I suppose I should reserve judgement till I see it though."
horns,4,"May 27, 2010","Clever and fun, a quick read... not exactly a ""horror"" novel, but good stuff anyway... our protagonist wakes up one day- Kafkaesque- to discover he's grown horns on his head... and everyone he encounters suddenly can't help but to spill their darkest, most shameful secrets to him... all of this is made much more intersting by the fact that our emergent devil's girlfriend was brutally murdered a year before. There's all sorts of great puns and popular culture references throughout, including lots of nods to rock and roll... and some erudite theological ruminations... a very different book than ""Heart Shaped Box"", but well worth checking out. I'm looking forward to more from Joe Hill."
horns,3,"May 17, 2013","I've been reading all the Joe Hill I can get; I actually put down Heart-Shaped Box to read this one. I did go back and finish the other one, BTW. I enjoyed the Kafkaesque situation of the main character, Ignatius (!!), who wakes one morning to find himself transformed...into the devil. The story is actually quite lovely and romantic, once you get past the perversions and violence. The Treehouse of the Mind (never mind about its owner) is a beautiful idea and image...C.S. Lewis' Screwtape would have enjoyed talking to Ig...as would Milton's Lucifer, of course. Hill is a smart writer...and he keeps developing."
horns,5,"March 31, 2014",Starts out Kafkaesque and gets better from there. Didn't go where I expected it to -- it was more interesting than that.
The Birthday Party,2,"January 20, 2023","When he's interrogated by the two men it reminded me of The Prisoner (1967) which makes me think there is the theme of conformity and the kafkaesque harassment and think of threats of surveillance (not that he was going into that, but relating to surveillance capitalism)"
The Birthday Party,3,"April 13, 2015","I loved this. Even though I only read the script, I could really picture it in my mind's eye. It was funny, heartbreaking and disconcerting. Had a kafkaesque quality to it."
The Z rau Aphorisms,4,"December 31, 2022","In the case of the Sonnets and indeed Kafka’s Aphorisms this gives them an inherently limitless potential for re-readability as we grow and our very subjective interpretation inevitably evolves. Someone with a greater literary facility, for example having read other works of Kafka or perhaps, specifically, with a little knowledge of the bible may very well utilise more well-informed powers of deduction in order to interpret them in a much more “accurate”, Kafkaesque manner. We cannot reason beyond our means but the many differing experiences of those who read these would make for some fascinating conversation!"
The Z rau Aphorisms,4,"March 16, 2022","The collection of aphorisms in this book are vast in its intellectual varieties and stimulation. In every aphorism you can immerse yourself in a profound Kafkaesque situation. Though some of these had surely Nietzschean flavour, you can't help loving every aphorism here. I never thought Kafka wrote or could write aphorism untill this book caught my eyes. And now i am living between the lines of his aphorisms. Lets take an example then:"
the strange library,5,"June 12, 2023","There is the dark underground labyrinth. The place of confinement. The Kafkaesque authority figure who issues bizarre commands as if they were commonplace, who threatens the most outlandish and horrific punishments for failing to meet preposterous demands."
the strange library,4,"November 26, 2016","The Strange Library is an entrancing Kafkaesque contemporary fairy tale that’s well-written, accessible and haunting. I happily gobbled it up in one sitting – not only will Murakami fans enjoy this but so will fans of Neil Gaiman and Guillermo del Toro as well."
the strange library,5,"March 30, 2021","Haruki Murakami rất biết cách khơi gợi những nỗi sợ sâu thẳm nhất của con người: nỗi sợ tối, sợ ở trong không gian hẹp, sợ bị giam cầm, sợ lạc, sợ không được an toàn, ... Khi đọc tới trang cuối cùng của cuốn sách, câu chuyện đột ngột kết thúc, mình có cảm giác mơ hồ. Thực sự ""Thư viện kỳ lạ"" là một cuốn sách đậm đặc ""kafkaesque"" - phong cách Kafka, nơi nhân vật chính luôn rơi vào vòng vây của những điều phi lý, không tài nào giải thích nổi, để đến cuối người đọc lại không thể ngừng suy nghĩ về câu chuyện."

The dialogue is that of a fifth grader, as is the grammar, vocab, etc. I think this is supposed to be high art, Kafkaesque or something, but as my first intro to this author - and in audio fashion, no less - the pearls were wasted on this swine. Yech. This lil piggy didn't get it."

the strange library,4,"October 14, 2019","A very kafkaesque short story for... children? Maybe. A quick read and pretty surreal as you'd expect from Murakami. I enjoyed it, but not as much as his usual novels."
the strange library,5,"December 21, 2014","This is a strange Kafkaesque tale of a young boy lost or trapped in a library. It more of a short story than a novel. The packaging and artwork only enhance the story. If you understand what it is about, I would love to hear your ideas. Still it was a fun short read."
the strange library,4,"December 28, 2018",Murakami brought a clean type of Kafkaesque into the childish world of young children.
the strange library,3,"August 14, 2017","I won't narrate the story, it's meant to be read. I like how Kafkaesque the narration reads - using juvenile language to narrate the tale of unfair punishment, guidance by a cowed but learned mentor, being aided or saved by a real or imaginary woman, and finally an anticlimactic freedom."
the strange library,3,"February 9, 2020","This Kafkaesque (with a dash of Poe) short novel begins as a realistic visit to the local public library. Soon, though, the young protagonist is sent on a wild journey into the bowels of the building, where tunnels and labyrinths take him to fantastical creatures, books, chains, and an unexpected jail cell. Is it all an illusion? A vision? It's impossible to categorize this dream-like fantasy piece, but I found it intriguing. The drawings, design, and large typewriter font made the reading experience a visual feast. I found that the illustrations, however, rarely connected to the storyline. Though visually provocative, they added a narrative to the story that I doubt Murakami would have wanted. Over-all? The book is a sinister but tasty short read worthy of a second glance."
the strange library,5,"July 4, 2020","Apart from this, the eerie atmosphere and the relation between the characters (the oppressed and the oppressive) seemed very Kafkaesque to me. I haven't read ""Kafka On The Shore"", so I don't know to what extent that novel is related to Kafka, but ""The Strange Library"" seems to be a lot. Just think of the maze that the characters have to walk through inside the library!"
the strange library,3,"October 14, 2024",although this is a very short story im afraid im just not that fond of murakamis writing style. its very entertaining and surrealist yes you can even call it kafkaesque but its also incredibly simple like it kind of just feels like you’re reading an old fable which is nice but at times feels a little 2d and underwhelming. i think the format of the book and all the artwork that goes along with it is very new and interesting tho.

the strange library,2,"December 30, 2015","I haven't read Murakami's complete catalog, but I usually enjoy his work. Then The Strange Library came along... The book's physicality features an interesting layout and visuals, but the story is, oh, what's the word, awful. I'm just not sure what the point is. At first, I thought it was going to be a Kafkaesque fable, something along the lines of Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane. But even that potential fails to come to fruition. I guess it's about an innocent person suffering the consequences of undeserved hostility? And libraries being evil/torturous? As much as I want to give Murakami the benefit of the doubt, I hated this book on a visceral level. I gave it 2 stars because of the creative layout and visuals."

the strange library,Not rated,"February 23, 2023","this has an exciting beginning, luring the reader into the deep and dark corridors of its library in a Kafkaesque way, but i think it steadily becomes less interesting over its brief length. some of the more interesting setups have little or no payoff, but it's still an enjoyable, short read."
the strange library,4,"February 6, 2015","Read this one between classes today. Not sure what to think. Short story? Novella? YA book (a tad too chilling/weird for that)? Murakami at his most enigmatic &amp; Kafkaesque. çool flaps/illustrations, but you can read it in a bookstore/library and save yourself $18."
the strange library,5,"May 22, 2015",Great short piece from Murakami - Kafkaesque with Japanese sensitivities.
the strange library,5,"September 24, 2020","A short, Kafkaesque read into darkness, uncertainty, identity, solitude and strangeness."
Hope Against Hope,4,"May 23, 2021","Sometimes difficult to follow the discursive narrative which skips between time, places and people. But a valuable account of the tribulations of those who fell foul of Stlin's state at the height of its paranoia. Osip Mandelstam and Nadezdha were just some of the flotsam buffeted about by the Kafkaesque Soviet State."
1919,4,"April 9, 2015","There is a Kafkaesque element in the book where war sentiment is everywhere used as a final word for social argument, despite the fact that no rationale can be articulated. J. W. Moorehouse is a prominent symbol of this as a publicity man who wanders vaguely through this volume making friends and influencing people without a moment of clarity or introspection. Meanwhile, those on the margins are abused by a system where half-baked ideas and fuzzy ideals reign."
what we talk about when we talk about anne frank,5,"April 6, 2015","There’s a Kafkaesque parable; a moving historical saga; a postmodern experiment about writing and autobiography; an erotic romp that takes a surreal turn. The title story, inspired by Raymond Carver’s classic ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,"" is a very funny but also serious look at trust, Jewish identity and, yes, love."
anna karenina,3,"July 11, 2025","Psychological nuances, emotional depths, spiritual longings - these are all accomplished with a flick of the pen. An aged patriarch coughing constantly when talking to a doctor about the care of his daughter, the decidedly modern and shameless Stepan Oblonsky suddenly blushing when his servants implore him to pray to God for forgiveness of adultery, Levin's profound irritation at the stupid and nonsensical replies of the muzhiks under his watch - these little actions add the 'show' to Tolstoy's sometimes verbose 'tell's regarding the spiritual makeup of his characters, but it also shows that, for all his reputation as a moralist, Tolstoy was not without a Kafkaesque vein of humor and irony."
Norwegian Wood,2,"September 10, 2023","Well, that's the story I'd rather it would have been: This was all so very ordinary. I like it so much more when Murakami packs his novels with loads of weird shit; like talking cats, Kafkaesque underworlds, and soldiers who mysteriously haven't aged since The Pacific War. I may or may not have appreciated this more as a teen and on some form of tricyclic medication, and as an angsty delicate as a wallflower coming-of-age sad and nostalgic love story, it certainly didn't leave me with a lump in the throat. The stirred emotions, at best, were more like a faint ripple than a wave."
Norwegian Wood,1,"March 27, 2021","This dude's writing is always marketed as Kafkaesque. I want to clarify that I haven't read any work of Franz Kafka (yet), so bear with me. Anyway, if Murakami's writing is definitely close to Kafka's, then fuck that. I will never, ever, pick up a book written by both of these dudes."
Norwegian Wood,5,"April 29, 2013","Yet another outstanding Murakami book. Simple compared to the other I have read but that is not to say it is without great depth. It's not filled with the usual Kafkaesque elements of his other novels, so at first it not seem to be consistent with the other Murakami books I have read."
Norwegian Wood,5,"May 29, 2018","There is a poignant simplicity in all of Murakami's work. The idea that a simple man's life is far more interesting than it might seem; the idea that every life is a story and an adventure solely by virtue of its existence. This is especially evident in Norwegian Wood. A refreshing perspective from the author, it lacks his typical Kafkaesque prose and a tendency towards the surreal. The book is first and foremost a story of love, its complexities and surprises; its effect on human emotion. Secondly, it's a story of death and loss, as well as ways of coping with grief. Various ways of dealing with love and loss are presented through the characters of Nagasawa (a high-reaching businessman intent on sleeping with as many women as possible, all the while ignoring his girlfriend), Kizuki and Toru himself. For example, the meaninglessness of sleeping around with strangers is Nagasawa's driving factor, contrasted with strong feelings Toru finds in erotic encounters. In probably one of his most direct and approachable books, Murakami thrives in capturing the often evasive shades of human emotion, and all the grayness in between."
Norwegian Wood,4,"October 5, 2017","This was my first Murakami book. Yes, yes, I know that this book doesn't reflect Murakami's writing style for which he is known. He's into talking cats and flying elephants and other Kafkaesque imageries while this book is...a love story. I sure had my reservations but this book pleasantly surprised me."
Norwegian Wood,4,"March 6, 2022","Norwegian Wood was my first Murakami novel. I thought the language was absolutely beautiful, with precise imagery. Although the author tackles incredibly sensitive and intense topics a young individual might face in life, the skillful use of language adds lightness to the novel. It seems to me that the book also portrays Kafkaesque elements, as the reader feels a sustained love and hatred in equal terms towards all characters, and especially Watanabe. While this is considered one of the author's most realistic novels to this day, it still captures a blend of fantasy and classic Murakami absurdity."
Norwegian Wood,4,"November 29, 2020","A shocking, mesmerizing book about life and death. Has a Kafkaesque mood throughout, but not executed perfectly (some dialogue seemed melodramatic or unnatural). Some transitions are abrupt but it fits the style. Really enjoyed characters like Reiko and Midori. It's a book that will haunt you lightly upon finishing, precisely *because* it's mundane and centered around things we all encounter: love, choice, will, impermanence, longing."
Norwegian Wood,5,"December 1, 2024","Murakami's uncomplicated prose: a profound exploration of life's early deaths. I enjoyed the reading, the style, the prose and the Kafkaesque elements of the story."
Norwegian Wood,4,"September 5, 2019","Very oriental Kafkaesque work from Haruki Murakami. Probably also gonna be the last one, that I am ever going to read. But who knows, time might change my mind."
Norwegian Wood,4,"June 7, 2024","My first take on Murakami. Tragic and Kafkaesque but weirdly enough the story, the characters and the immersion into Toru's Japan was transmitting me peace."
Norwegian Wood,1,"July 5, 2024",DNF. Boring. Was hoping for a love story? I can’t explain why anyone would want to read this. Kafkaesque Mess.

Bartleby and Benito Cereno,5,"August 19, 2014","Benito Cereno is in itself an interesting tale of an unusual rebellion on a slave ship, and it is made all intriguing by being closely based on the story of a real slave rebellion aboard a Spanish merchant ship over 50 years earlier in 1799. However it is Herman Melville’s almost Kafkaesque but infuriatingly funny tale of Bartleby The Scrivener that shines brightest in this duo of Melville stories. This tale deserves be as well-known as that other Melville story about a whale fixation."

Kafka on the Shore,4,"June 9, 2021","Despite the title, and the name Kafka has chosen, this isn’t a Kafkaesque story. However, in Czech, Kafka sounds like the word for crow or jackdaw, and in this, Kafka’s alter-ego is “the boy called Crow”."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"April 15, 2014","Murakami's Kafka on the Shore is philosophical, surrealistic, sexual, full of mysticism, musical, subliminal, so.... ""Kafkaesque""! Highly recommended for those who are looking for a unique or different reading experience."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"October 19, 2023","The nickname of the main character, as he himself reveals, was taken from Franz Kafka. At a deeper level, however, one cannot miss that the style of the novel itself is Kafkaesque. Franz Kafka explored the absurdity of social order and human condition. Murakami, instead, puts the sheet of the absurd upon the supernatural. ""Kafka on the Shore"" is a journey in which the boundary between reality and fantasy is so blurred that the reader can hardly distinguish between the two. While reading, I often wondered: “Is this someone's dream?” “Or is this someone’s madness?” “Or maybe it is a collective dream?” I think that this intentional uncertainty, this foggy state, pushes the reader to explore the depths of the human soul and, ultimately, to question the state of his own life."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"January 18, 2019","The story line combines, magical reality, surrealism and what comes closer to Dadaism. Reading Kafka on the Shore can be like riding a bucking bronco. There are a lot of reason to ride anything, only a few for riding a bucking bronco. If by surprise you find yourself on such a wild horse, you cannot be faulted for being grumpy. Kafka on the shore is Kafkaesque. It will slide and elide in, parallel with and outside of reality; adhering to and ignoring conventional morality. Its logic is entirely internal to itself. It may be a very hard read for anyone with little prior exposure to Murakami. Be advised."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"May 27, 2017","Murakami. If nothing else, his books are completely unique and almost immediately recognizable. As a complete tangent, Murakami is actually the 35th most common surname in Japan, yet any basic search will yield Haruki Murakami as the first result. I honestly feel sorry for Ryu Murakami, another author. Anyhow, back to the Murakami at hand. His books, however weird, however shocking, however unique, always do one thing right. They are transporting. I always feel a shock of some sort returning to reality after a good session with a Murakami novel. What makes a Murakami? The blatant sexuality, the popular culture references, the power of beauty and music (especially classical), Japanese history (especially wartime), Buddhism and other religious traditions (especially Shinto, shrines are also often featured), unrequited love, themes of loneliness, coming-of-age, Kafkaesque fatalism, surrealism, magical realism, fantasy, dreams, alternate reality, involved characters, characters commenting on how strange things are, telephone calls from nowhere, characters becoming unexpected detectives (his work is often compared to Raymond Chandler).&nbsp;"
Kafka on the Shore,3,"October 2, 2021","Ce titre ne déçoit pas, Kafka sur le rivage livre un expérience tout a fait Kafkaesque. L'on est plonge dans un autre pays plein de mystère. Les chats parlent. Les omnis visitent. Des personnages ont des maladies sinistres. Une explosion sexuelle semble être toujours imminent."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"March 10, 2017",This was amazing. What word to use? Daliesque? Kafkaesque?
Kafka on the Shore,1,"October 18, 2023","This novel interested me for a couple of reasons. The title ‘Kafka on the Shore’ is an intriguing one. I like Franz Kafka’s novels and short stories for their existentialist themes. Perhaps this novel could be a ‘Kafkaesque’ one with a Japanese perspective, which fascinated me. I had read Murakami’s short stories and found them quite underwhelming, leaving me wondering why he is an acclaimed fiction writer. This book, being a lengthy one, I felt could provide the answer for me. However, wading through this 470-page novel, I found I had inadvertently stepped into a world of fantasy, surrealism, dreams and inexplicable events. Besides, it was dotted with raw, explicit descriptions of sexual acts and scenes of brutal killings of helpless animals. The narrative in this novel follows the traditional Japanese “I-Novel” style, which uses a first-person, confessional style of flow, often dealing with a dark and personal subject. Many of Murakami’s works feature the lonesome, first-person male narrator as the protagonist. Let us explore the essence of this novel."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"February 19, 2024","Weird character, magic realism, some graphic sexual descriptions. Exactly how you expect a Murakami novel to be. However, the novel also seemed more kafkaesque? Bizarre phenomenons, ambiguous storylines and meandering descriptions of plot points which are left open to interpretation in the end. While this is not my favourite Murakami, it was still an interesting read."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"March 11, 2023","Which brings the story to it’s title, and the man inspiring that title. The Kafkaesque’ness of ‘Kafka on the shore’ is something emphasized through the reader’s own interpretation of the characters take on their fate. Hoshino decides that the concious choice to deny his responsibilities made his life for the better, and that it has, contradictory, taught him a responsibility to life, because he accepts the bizarreness of his own situation and because he doesn’t need to understand it. He sees that Nakata doesn't. Nataka continues his way of life in the most tragic and fulfilled way, being the most perfect human, in acceptance , when challenged with the inevitable hardships of the Kafkaesque. To go with the current, and not fight against it, is the same as accepting destiny with free will. If he ever made that clear to himself, that would defeat the purpose entirely. Hoshino, on the other hand, is an example of how people, we the people, are able to live with the bizarreness of fate - to question it, but accept it, and to never forget it."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"September 3, 2011","Murakami's novel is certainly Kafkaesque, but it's also tender and funny and inspiring. Both Kafka Tamura and Satoru Nakata are honorable and empathetic characters who as a reader you can't help but root for. Kafka has clearly had a troubled childhood and his father didn't help matters. When he runs away from home he is searching for himself as well as his mother and sister and like any coming of age story the trials he goes through, both mental and physical, shape his future in a positive way. Nakata is a tragic character because he is dumb and lives on a ""sub city"" from the ""Governor"" as he says. But he's also a strong character because he is unselfish and good (he kills the mysterious cat killer only to save the lives of other cats he has befriended and because the man encourages him to kill him). But for me it's the magical realism that makes the story so amazing. The reader never really knows what is real and what is not in the story. Some of the characters and events may or may not be what they appear to be, and may even be figments of Kafka's imagination. These mysteries do not ultimately reveal themselves but rather the reader is left to ponder them at the conclusion of the book. In fact, after the novel was published Murakami put up a website for readers to ask questions and it received more than 8,000!"
Kafka on the Shore,5,"June 11, 2021","If you are searching for answers don't read this book I say. But if you want to sway in the trance of magical realism then give Murakami a shot. His work is not any simple work. It is a feeling, a state of mind. It is only after reading Franz Kafka's work that you understand the word 'Kafkaesque'. Similarly, it is only after you read a Murakami book that you will understand what magical realism feels like as its best."
Kafka on the Shore,2,"October 26, 2024","The lack of clarity in the story, at least to me, suggests the author’s attempts to write something Kafkaesque, but it falls flat. Kafkaesque has to do with the often unsuccessful navigation and wrestling with societal customs that are seemingly arbitrary, and falling victim to rules that even the enforcers of can’t adequately explain. This book, despite the title and name of the protagonist, does not fit the description."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"September 26, 2014","In true Kafkaesque fashion, Murakami raises existential questions around life, choices, mortality."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"August 14, 2016","As the name of the book suggests, Murakami seems quite influenced by the works of the great Franz Kafka; and to see Kafkaesque elements settling down subtly well into this magical Murakami orbit is an out of the world experience."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"March 3, 2009","If 'Kafkaesque' means feeling like one is living in a nightmare, then what is the word for feeling like one is living in a dream? Or more to the point, for reading a book that feels like reading a dream? Because that's what reading this book was like - a melange of mythology, pop culture, high culture, historical references and talking cats - just like a dream. I can't pretend like I intellectually understood much of the book, but then again, who wakes up in the morning after a night filled with particularly vivid dreams and can make intellectual sense of them? But on a deeper, more instinctual level, I got it. Recommended for adventurous readers who don't always need everything to make sense."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"September 5, 2018",Actual real life exemplary of what Kafkaesque really is.
Kafka on the Shore,3,"January 29, 2022","Some people like to interpret some meaning into this book; I wouldn't bother. I would take the experience of reading this book (mostly confusedly saying ""wtf"" every few paragraphs) and read some less kafkaesque books (or Wikipedia articles) if you want to take away some life lessons."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"March 7, 2024","This book is a bit of a mixed bag. It has a lot going for it, with a fascinating mystery, proze that reads like a vivid fever dream and quite a few modern lessons about love, self-appreciation, and coping with change. And yet, I can't help but eye-roll my way through a passage about a way-too-detailed wet dream that causes spontaneous periods or frown as I read about a woman of fifty bedding a teenager (once unconsciously and once consciously), especially when the characters only consider it odd because the woman might be his mother. It distracted me, and that 'romance' was quite cringe. Overall the ending doesn't really give you any answers, but unlike other stories of this author I didn't necessarily expect any. The title honours Kafka, and this book certainly lives up to Kafkaesque standards."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"February 7, 2022","My first time reading Murakami. It is surreal and engaging and I found myself pretty easily carried along through the story. Aspects are quite strange, though not Kafkaesque as one might presume from the title. It is strewn with some lingering, interesting ideas. However, on the whole I found most of the philosophical questions and ideas were explicit in the dialog, particularly of the character of Oshima. The book speaks about the power and importance of metaphor yet its deepest ideas are not couched in metaphor but explicit oration from 1 or 2 characters. However, maybe I just didn't see the metaphor...maybe a future rereading will prove helpful."

Kafka on the Shore,5,"December 19, 2015","As I sit down to pen this review, after having finished the book only a few minutes back, I'm positively beaming. From the outset, let me make it absolutely clear that this is a wonderful wonderful book. No two ways about it. Not every author can write such a book - this book's far too unique, unconventional, half Kafkaesque, completely Murakamiesque."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"February 15, 2023","The first symbol in the novel is the concept of ""Kafkaesque."" The term ""Kafkaesque"" is derived from the works of the famous Czech writer Franz Kafka, who wrote novels and short stories that explored the themes of alienation and absurdity. The term ""Kafkaesque"" refers to situations that are surreal and illogical, where individuals are caught in a system that they cannot comprehend. The character of Kafka Tamura embodies the essence of the Kafkaesque. Kafka is on a quest to find his identity and his place in the world, but he is constantly thwarted by his father's curse, which forces him to confront his own deepest fears and anxieties."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"April 29, 2023","A 21st-century Oedipal adventure novel, set on a shore that blurringly separates the land of logic, order, consciousness, and realism from a sea of symbols, metaphors, subconsciousness and surrealism, Haruki Murakami's 'Kafka On The Shore"" is a 'mind-boggling read' to the truest sense of the term. Through a concoction of a contemporary blend of Oedipus and Orpheus, East and West, Freud and Jung, Hegel and Marx, Tales of Genji and The Arabian Nights, Shinto and Buddhism, abstraction and action, alternating narratives and parallel worlds, seriousness and play (not to mention the occasional references of classical, jazz and pop music), Murakami has managed to serve an art-piece that is weirdly Kafkaesque and yet uniquely Murakami-ish from the first page to the last."
Kafka on the Shore,2,"November 15, 2024","The story line was clearly moving forward to something, but what I’m still not exactly sure. It felt like the plot was too explained, with certain point really explained in so much detail or lines between events drawn so obviously it was eye rolling. At the same time it seems to have no plot at all. Maybe I missed the point, or maybe there wasn’t one. Maybe it’s trying a bit too hard to be kafkaesque."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"January 9, 2022","Reading this book felt like being in a dream but it's not exactly your own dream. Happenstances are quite common. Everything is unpredictable and some events don't even make sense. But I love how Murakami creates this bizarre, Kafkaesque adventure through the two memorable journeys of Nakata and Kafka Tamura. It is a book that can mean something different for every person who reads it; something that's interpretable to a great extent. The metaphors, magic and existential dread never made it a tiring read despite it being a fairly long book. However, it's the message of finding purpose within yourself and, the importance of memories and imagination that makes this book so special."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"December 9, 2015","Magic realism, dreams, paintings, books, post war Japan, utopia, raining leeches, deep forests, mysterious visitors, bending gender identities, beaches, classical music, books, and a plethora of characters come beautifully together in this splendid novel. Two parallel storylines converge and don't. Kafkaesque? Umm... a 5/5 for sure!"
Kafka on the Shore,3,"July 22, 2022","kafkaesque book def, everything felt like a fever dream."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"May 25, 2017","This was a tumbling, mind-boggling, if not mind-breaking story. Particularly loved the kafkaesque hues (Murakami's Kafka is much more pleasant than his original namesake). The Greek metaphors spread throughout the book were the crow(ning) glory for me. A riveting read!"
Kafka on the Shore,3,"June 29, 2024","A whole book which feels like one never ending dream. If you are looking for a book before going to bed you are at the right place… it can really put you to sleep! Very kafkaesque (duh) and confusing, leaves you wondering about it long after you finish reading."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"April 18, 2015","Aptly named, the novel's story is thoroughly Kafkaesque—wherein a mysteriously disabled old man can speak intelligently with cats; a boy (taking on the pseudonym Kafka Tamura) follows some bizarre and at times incestuous impulses that he can't exactly define; seemingly immortal spirits communicate with the living by taking on the forms of pop-culture icons, etc.—and was therefore right up my otherwise-easily-bored alley."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"June 3, 2023","there was a lot of references to freud, yeats, kafkaesque, all integrated to create murakami’s dream like odyssey."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"June 13, 2020","I adored all of the cultural references throughout. The references to Japanese folklore and literature now draw me into learning more about a world I previously knew nothing about. I found it only polite to listen to the numerous musical numbers referenced throughout, and particularly enjoyed discovering the music of Duke Ellington and Prince, as well as more of the work of The Beatles, which I already adored. I have a few new books in my to-read list as well, and it's even taught me more about the works of Kafka which I've already read, and the idea of what it is to be Kafkaesque, which our primary character is down to the core."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"September 1, 2022","I finished “Kafka on the shore” some days ago and still could not digest it totally. It took me 2 or 3 days, just to let my mind wander on its own, musing over the things that had just happened in the book and internalising them. Well, no luck with that, I suppose, so here I am, expressing the first things popping in my mind spontaneously about this one. (Who knows Murakami himself might have written it like this, given the obscurity and pointlessness) This is my second acquaintance with Murakami (The first one was “Norwegian Wood""). It is one of the weirdest books I have come across so far. That’s the point with Murakami, though. Being weird, kafkaesque, obscure, and yet simple and beautiful at the same. I loved it and hated it intensely at the same time! The question is, which impression is stronger?"
Kafka on the Shore,4,"January 29, 2022","Speaking of unknowable forces, I liked and disliked Colonel Sanders. He's not a person, but a thing, a mechanism of the universe that has things that must be done and just does them. I think he was fascinating to explore, yet at the same time, just another extension of Murakami having things that just happen without logic behind them. Though, the whole Sanders thing having such a snappy personality was funny. It felt eldritch (and vaguely Kafkaesque sorta) to me, this incomprehensible force having to take the form of something familiar, in order to set forward a complicated set of Rube-Goldberg-esque actions, in order to balance the dimensional shenanigans."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"July 4, 2025","To really do well with this book, you should know the myth of Oedipus from Sophocles or Homer, be familiar with the author Kafka and/or what Kafkaesque means, Jungian Psychology (Anima, Animus, Archetypes, Collective Unconscious, and complexes), and looking up some Japanese words as well as have some basic understanding of the Japanese culture since the story is dealing with the psyche of Japanese man who grew up within the cultural context of Japan."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"January 18, 2022","Now, this is a weird book. Weird in the good sense. But weird only because of my innate tendency to adhere to reason. Although it’s fiction, I’ve tended to reason beyond what’s provided. To make connections in the plot. At some point, I even felt the protagonist to be like the one in the movie,  Predestination . But once you get accustomed to the uncanniness and give yourself in, you’ll find solace in it. You’ll realise that Murakami consciously omitted these, probably to accentuate the Kafkaesque-ness."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"August 20, 2020",Some reader here asked whether people thought of this book as Kafkaesque (why is spell-checker not accepting Kafkaesque?) I wrote:
Kafka on the Shore,5,"September 16, 2021","The Kafkaesque nature of this book was intriguing, with the actual main protagonist, (Nakata was definitely not really a protagonist) Kafka running away from a fate that was impossible to avoid. Everything he did just brought him closer to what his father had prophecised he would do."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"May 23, 2022","But then I continued and tried to finish it. I had hated teen from Catcher in the Rye, and I hated Kafka. Nakata and Hoshino were the only good characters, and their arcs are just left like ripples. The pointlessness of everything grew hard to bear. Maybe if this book had been 200 pages shorter, I would have enjoyed it. Reading the graphic descriptions and them taking you nowhere in the story is pointless. Reading this book is the definition of Kafkaesque - being burdened with pointlessness of things."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"June 24, 2022","I really enjoyed this book and it was exactly everything I wanted from it. I do think that I left a lot on the table in terms of understanding the book and it’s symbolism and I will be rereading it in order to catch everything I missed. It seems to be a bit misleading on purpose, sort of the way Kafkaesque writing is normally however I wonder how much is lost in translation between Japanese and English. I feel like Kafka in the book is a metaphor for growth and maturity and the idea that it is impossible to be yourself because the concept of self is always changing. You can plan as much as you want but it’s impossible to be who you truly are because who you truly are is a result of how you experience the present. The book placed a lot of emphasis on memory and how it interacted with a person’s sense of self and had a very open concept to how memory and time function. I viewed time in the story as a fluid mechanism, something that can simultaneously be happening all at once: past, present and future. Overall there isn’t too much to say about the plot: it was enjoyable and interesting because it was so obviously deep and allegorical. I will say there was a lot of more sex and sexual motifs than I expected and it was hard to tell if that was symbolic or if it was a plot device. I will definitely read this book again and try to come up with a better answer for everything in the story and what it stands for."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"June 30, 2022","I expected this book to be more Kafkaesque. It was as if the author had attempted a Kafkaesque story, but it wasn't quite as disorienting as I'd hope for. It had an ""underworld"" feel to it, like those often found in many of Neil Gaiman's novels."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"January 31, 2024","""Kafka on the Shore"" by Haruki Murakami is a mesmerizing journey into the surreal, where letting go of the absurdity of the story becomes essential for truly appreciating its depth. As always, Murakami does not adhere to traditional storytelling conventions. The narrative weaves together elements of magical realism, dreamlike sequences, and unexplainable occurrences that challenge the reader's ability to rationalize all that is taking place. If you approach this book with a rigid analytical mindset, you're likely to find yourself lost in a labyrinth. Instead, let go of the need for explanations and embrace the inexplicable, reject the Kafkaesque pursuit of understanding, abandon the search for an exit and allow the forest to swallow you whole."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"February 8, 2019","3.5 Kafka On The Shore by Haruki Murakami (e-library Audio Book — Complete Text Unabridged. Read by Sean Barrett and Oliver Le Sueur.) This is the first long novel I’ve experienced in audio form, and although the readers did an excellent job, there is a difference between listening to a book and reading it yourself. As a certain visual artist, K. M. Rivadenaeira, has observed: “Hearing a story is a very subtle experience. You listen to the breath of the storyteller, and to his tone.” Admittedly this wasn’t oral storytelling per se, but narrating in an objective voice. Still there is a subtle difference experiencing a novel in audio form. I’ve finished it, at last. It felt like it was going on for ever. Ha! Yes, too long. The repetitions of “I shake my head” and “I nod” along with the ever polite “May I ask you a question” began to take their toll. The characters were likeable, but I’m still not sure whether I enjoyed the story, even though it was compelling enough to stay with till the bitter end. A very strange story. Metaphysical and mystical. Kafkaesque that’s for sure."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"September 23, 2022","Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai particulièrement apprécié cette intelligence complexe de l'auteur. L'érudition de Murakami reste toujours discrète, mais monumentale : il les disperse, les dissimule presque à travers les pages de Kafka sur le rivage : la trame de fond est kafkaesque; elle est aussi oedipienne; les héros sont tragiques; les personnages sont des terrains d'une dialectique philosophique dont le noyau central est l'acceptation et l'amour de leur destin respectif (ce que j'ai particulièrement apprécié, faisant partie de mes préoccupations du moment)."
Kafka on the Shore,1,"January 22, 2024","I hated the main character calling himself Kafka the most, no matter how Kafkaesque the book was. Even the few funny or deep nuggets of insight into human soul such as cats boasting about not being able to read or comparing being in mourning to living in a frozen expanse of time did not help change my mind about the book."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"March 19, 2017","This was my first Murakami read after a friend's recommendation. I usually don't read literary magical realism/fantasy, but I was curious. And Kafka on the Shore was a refreshing, though outright one of the weirdest stories I've ever read. The narrative follows 15 year old Kafka Tamura who runs away from home (and an Oedipal prophecy) and the intersecting storyline of Nakata, a retired man with mental disability who finds himself caught up with Kafka's world. And although I've been meaning to, but haven't read any of Franz Kafka's works yet, this does have the surrealistic quality noted as 'Kafkaesque,' which makes for the bizarre experience which both enticed and repulsed me at times. I can see how Murakami's writing style for pointing out what is going on the story itself, which sometimes I wasn't sure if they sounded a bit on the nose (e.g. a mention of Chekov and the rifle in the room having a purpose), but at other instances found they worked through discussions of mythology, music, and literature (Oshima was an awesome character!). And through some of these passages (yes, some sounded unnecessarily long winded), Murakami muses about themes of life which we could take to heart (finding your other half, emptiness vs. memories, what it means to live, etc.). That said it's hard to pin down a single thing to describe what this book is about. Murakami leaves it up to the reader to come to their own conclusions and takeaways. In regards to Kafka trying to figure out how his prophecy/curse fits in with the people he met, he's presented with evidence for his working hypothesis, and he continues to hold onto it until he finds counterevidence. Anyway, the only negative aspect I had to say about this book was the pacing where in certain chapters nothing happened aside from the characters waiting for something to happen. Otherwise Kafka on the Shore was a pretty engaging and memorable read."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"April 16, 2023","It reads like an early high school English class novel--lots of symbolism and cultural references to annotate that explain the ups and downs of the plot. For example, I was confused why Kafka ran away from home to escape the curse that fated him to sleep with his mother and sister, but as soon as he meets the woman who he thinks is his mother he says to himself, ""I'm in love with her and I want to have sex with her."" I would have thought he'd narrate some resistance to his urge, given that he narrated every other small thought that he had. Something that is Kafkaesque is nightmare-like and the person has little control over what happens. So of course a character named Kafka would live out his curse without any thought. Overall it's a quintessential post-modern fiction piece. Didn't resonate with me though"
Kafka on the Shore,3,"November 11, 2024","This book reads like a fever dream. I can appreciate that it was meant to be Kafkaesque, &amp; it most definitely was exactly that. There were a couple of plot points that were brought up at the beginning of the story &amp; then dropped, which drove me a bit nuts. Nakata is the boy who passed out on the mountain with a group of other students due to some WWII gas attack over Japan? But then he is able to talk to animals &amp; is able to pass on this ability having nothing to do with the war? Perhaps I’ve either majorly misunderstood or am meant to be left confused."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"August 29, 2018","The reason I first picked up Kafka on the Shore was because the title has “Kafka” in it and Kafka is one writer that deserves all the respect and attention in the world. I was not necessarily expecting the book to make references to him but to my surprise, he and his ideas were very much a central theme. Trust me, the Kafkaesque stylistic elements and references to Franz Kafka himself are impossible to miss."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"July 16, 2018","Kafkaesque... and almost too odd to appreciate. But the oddness kept me reading, definitely intrigued. I do wish at the end some of the threads came together in a clever and ""I did not see this coming but it makes a lot of sense now"" kind of way, but I was a bit disappointed when they didn't. What was left unexplained felt like madness added to the book for the sake of it."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"May 28, 2023","I did some preliminary research on Murakami before diving into the book and discovered his exclusive genre called verisimilitude. It's a fascinating concept that explores the fine line between fiction and reality, akin to Kafkaesque. although I enjoyed the absurd dream-like situations, there were some truly mind-boggling and unsettling parts of the book."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"January 27, 2024","Tali yang terselubung antara 2 realitas dalam novel ini mampu membawa pembaca melayang lebih jauh dengan imajinasinya, seperti yang disebutkan secara eksplisit dari novel ini: Segalanya adalah metafora. Di sisi lain Murakami meskipun menciptakan banyak hal abstrak seperti hubungan antara Nakata dan Kafka Tamura atau kondisi Oedpius Complex yang dialami Kafka Tamura, tetap membuat saya terpacu untuk menikmati setiap bagian cerita dan di saat yang bersamaan dapat merasakan unsur Kafkaesque-nya."
Kafka on the Shore,1,"August 11, 2018","I tried. I really tried to like this book. I read about half of it and don't see any reason to waste another week of my life on it. I just didn't like any part of it. I've never read Kafka, but reading this book written in a Kafkaesque style shows me that I never want to read another book with the word Kafka on the cover--whether it's the title or the author's name."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"April 29, 2020","Like the name of the book, there is Kafkaesque elements strewn throughout the book. The boundary between normal and abnormal seems to vanish from time to time and the characters from both sides seem to cross over without much difficulty. I felt this book was about loneliness and the yearning to fill the void within."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"November 26, 2022",Really had to force myself to finish this one. All in all it’s very interesting how not Kafkaesque this book was and how it feels more fantastic than dreadful. I love how music was such an integral part of the story and how it transformed the life of Hoshino and shifted Kafka’s priorities. Also Hoshino best story lol.
Kafka on the Shore,3,"June 28, 2018","Very kafkaesque. Still puzzled about many things. If you like philosophical, dark ideas, this book is probably for you."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"June 25, 2019",One word to this story : Kafkaesque
Kafka on the Shore,3,"August 7, 2020",I couldn't understand in the first attempt but it is definitely captivating. Very kafkaesque!
Kafka on the Shore,5,"March 15, 2021","soo kafkaesque 🙏🙏 definitely filled with metaphors and symbolism that i didnt get, however still thoroughly enjoyed it and i liked oshima's super pretentious lectures!"
Kafka on the Shore,4,"April 2, 2021",Kafkaesque.
Kafka on the Shore,3,"July 25, 2022",kafkaesque
Kafka on the Shore,5,"February 1, 2023",well it was certainly kafkaesque… i loved it. after you get used to the flow and the surrealism the characters become more vibrant and relatable.
Kafka on the Shore,5,"June 10, 2025",Kafkaesque
Kafka on the Shore,5,"June 6, 2025","Okay so- to preface- I love Franz Kafka's work so much. I have read almost everything that Kafka has ever written. Keep that in mind. When I started reading Kafka on the shore, I expected a Murakami novel (I've only read one other), but did not expect what I can only describe as a love letter to Kafka. What I found was not only an homage to the style and themes of Kafka's works, but a layered novel that filters Kafkaesque themes through a distinctly Japanese, post-World War II lens. Murakami doesn’t copy Kafka; he converses with him, critiques him, and carries his legacy into new terrain."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"July 20, 2024",very kafkaesque. would not expect anything less creative and dreamy from haruki murakami. i long for a day i get to enter this reality and see what it's like
Kafka on the Shore,4,"July 18, 2020","Standing on the shoulder of the literary giant, Franz Kafka (one of Murakami’s favorite writers, obviously), I was curious how Murakami would go about it. Came around to reading it finally and I’m pleased to say it did not disappoint. It was entertaining from start to finish and I even found myself rereading some chapters which I seldom do to any regular book. More importantly, was it Kafkaesque enough? Yes, I believe so."
Kafka on the Shore,3,"July 2, 2021","This book was a lot to take in, especially the lengthy descriptions, many allusions, and constant dialogue. Personally, I found that many of the topics became redundant. While some philosophical allusions aided in the story's plot, I wished there were fewer ideas and more cohesion between them. However, I guess that's what makes the book ""Kafkaesque."" It's unnecessarily complicated. Also, I vehemently opposed the incestual prophecy. I did not enjoy reading the specifics of Kafka's engagements with his ""sister"" and ""mother."" The book otherwise was pretty remarkable. The narratives of Kafka and Nakata really get the reader invested and the latter half of the book was a page-turner. I wish we could've seen their paths actually converge though."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"May 25, 2025","narration is good. book got 2 story telling at same time. but nothing kafkaesque, i felt."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"April 14, 2012","According to the the merriam-webster dictionary, Kafkaesque is defined as: of, relating to, or suggestive of Franz Kafka or his writings;especially : having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality. And if I were to sum up the book in one sentence, it would be exactly that. Haruki Murakami actually won the Franz Kafka Prize in 2006, and I'm guessing, by the title of the book, this book was intentionally made way too bizarre and/or illogical. But that is the what the beauty of the book is - what keeps the reader so captivated and mesmerized throughout, even though absolutely nothing makes sense."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"October 19, 2023","Truyện làm mình thực sự lung lay trước một định đề lớn của Triết học mà Murakami đã khai thác: Con người có ý chí tự do (free will) hay chúng ta chỉ là những những cuộc đời đã được định sẵn bởi số mệnh? Trong Kafka bên bờ biển, nhân vật Kafka như chìm trong một cơn ác mộng của phức cảm Oedipus, đã biết trước kết cục của hành trình này, nhưng lại bất lực không thể nào làm khác đi được. Và thật trùng hợp, nhân vật chính trong truyện tự đặt tên cho mình là Kafka. Cho những bạn nào chưa biết, thì Kafka là một nhà văn nổi tiếng về thể loại văn học phi lý khi ném nhân vật của mình vào những tình huống oái oăm, bất ngờ, không lời giải thích (được gọi là Kafkaesque). Và dù chỉ mới đọc hai tác phẩm của Kafka là Hoá thân và Vụ án, nhưng thật sự mình có thể nhận thấy Murakami chịu ảnh hưởng rất nhiều từ Kafka. Vì vậy, nhân vật Kafka Tamura vừa là một sự tri ân, vừa là một sự ám thị về bi kịch định mệnh không thể nào thoái khỏi của anh chàng này (ám thị sự tương đồng với nhân vật K. trong Vụ án của Kafka)."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"February 10, 2016",I'm sad that I finished Kafka on the Shore. I don't think a book like this will be written again. It deserves to be called as one of the brilliant works of literature published in the last 10 years. I absolutely enjoyed the characters talk about books written by Goethe and Franz Kafka. Murakami finally talks about Kafka who they say his writing most resembles to or is also termed as Kafkaesque. The suspense is beautifully woven with some brilliant prose by Murakami. My favorite lines from the novel are:
Kafka on the Shore,4,"July 7, 2010","This is my second Murakami. If The Wind-up Bird Chronicle was like being in a Kafkaesque world of metaphysical surrealism, Kafka on the Shore felt like being in a Freudian dream sequence. The story itself is endlessly fascinating and would likely require a couple of re-reads for one to understand it completely. Reading this in the English translation made me come to a decision. That, if I'm to read a Murakami novel again it would have to be in Japanese. I wasn't happy with the translation. It kept using expressions and phrases that are very Western and having a Japanese culture-rich background, it didn't feel right for me. Presumably, the translation was done in such a way that aids English readers but I still believe translations should retain the nuances of the original."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"August 24, 2017","Kafkaesque! The book is splendid, and hauntingly beautiful. I got to the part of the book where the plot thickens and gets so dense, I used to finish a chapter, and kay staring at the ceiling. I took an off from work, just to savor each line, the hidden realities of life that Murakami springs up on you."
Kafka on the Shore,Not rated,"February 8, 2016","A truly apt name for the book, Murakami presents, in his first venture into the beautiful world of words, a veritably Kafkaesque book, connecting two seemingly disjoint stories into a single one. The book seldom leaves time to dwell on the intricacies of life. An amazing story weave in English that actually makes me want to learn Japanese so that I may enjoy the unfettered style in which the book was written."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"July 18, 2022","It is an undeniable fact that Kafka on the Shore is one of Murakami's most complex novels, often regarded as a gateway to his fiction. Re-reading it after five years made me understand the Kafkaesque and puzzling dimension of it better. A work which would inevitably become a classic one day due to its kaleidoscopic form and substance. May not be one of my top Murakami novels, yet it doesn't fail to amaze me of the labyrinth he has woven."
Kafka on the Shore,5,"January 19, 2015","Pretty amazing read. The intertwining of the different (2 or 3 stories, depending on how you count them) is amazing and keeps you on the edge of the chair until the end. While the story is quite subreal (Kafkaesque would be another description) while you are reading it feels quite real and next door. My first book from Murakami, looking forward to the other books from him as well."
Kafka on the Shore,Not rated,"April 28, 2014",Mundanely Kafkaesque in the best way possible.
Kafka on the Shore,1,"May 3, 2017","Kafkaesque indeed. I couldn't stomach it -- when he starts describing killing cats, I'm done."
Kafka on the Shore,4,"November 6, 2017","Though as a hint; I feel closely related with Nabokov's lolita (emotionally) and Akhteruzzaman's chilekothar sepai (metaphorically) but that's just me. Murakami portrayed Kafka in a spiritual realm, Putting Kafkaesque in different perspective. It introduced me to some classical masterpiece as Beethoven's archduke trio and Schumann's symphony in A minor. Still trying to understand those."
The Baron in the Trees,4,"February 25, 2011","When you read multiple works by an author, you start to identify characteristics and themes that unify the oeuvre and allow for adjectives like ""Kafkaesque"" and ""Joycean."" The Baron in the Trees is the fourth novel I've read by Italo Calvino, who I consider one of my favorite authors. My experience with Calvino has been somewhat odd, however, because the order in which I've read these four books is almost exactly the opposite order in which he wrote them. I have no doubt that an elderly Calvino would enjoy that chronological discrepancy and have a few creative ideas to share about it."
The Baron in the Trees,3,"August 31, 2019","Although I've finished the book I don't know whether I like it or not. Certainly I was about ready to give up after the first hundred pages because it seemed like nothing was happening. A young, rebellious son of the aristocracy has a falling out with his family, climbs a tree and stays there - for the rest of his life. It's an interesting premise, and at first seemed Kafkaesque, but nothing seemed to happen. He was innovative. He found ways of comping with a lifestyle above ground but so what? I read to the end only because I hate giving up but somewhere around page 150 I started becoming interested. True, there isn't so much a plot as a string of anecdotes tied together by that business of being up in the trees but gradually a theme began to emerge - a theme of being outside, and possibly above the world and yet wanting to connect to it. The protagonist is far from perfect. He has plenty of faults yet he is constantly engaging and trying to understand the world around him. In the end, I found myself quite enjoying the story but I have to admit, it took me a long while to get there and some of the twists and turns were either bizarre or I simply didn't understand them."
Jane and Prudence,4,"October 17, 2024","Lovely novel set in immediate post WW2 Britain limning the lives of two friends, Jane And Prudence. Prudence works in Kafkaesque academic support role to a supposed genius. Jane is a vicar’s wife who tries matchmaking Prudence with men from her rural parish. Prudence is interested in romance if not necessarily marriage. Both women are worldly wise within their own not quite overlapping spheres and struggle with one another accordingly though not acrimoniously. Gentle comedy ensues."
the idiot,4,"August 8, 2022","That it never goes anywhere is offset by Batuman's wit. Though Selin is largely passive, Batumen does allow her underlying intelligence to give us some wry commentary on the to-and-fro of college life and, later, the Kafkaesque culture shock of visiting Eastern Europe. It's a writer's Bildungsroman that culminates in the observation that: ""Maybe the point of writing wasn’t just to record something past but also to prolong the present, like in One Thousand and One Nights, to stretch out the time until the next thing happened."""
the idiot,4,"May 26, 2025","In the beginning I loved how bluntly the haphazard events were described in a Kafkaesque way, as they gave metaphorical insight into Selin’s thoughts and feelings. As the book progressed however, the majority of these events seemed to served no purpose within the grand scheme of the novel. The last lines of “The Idiot” would have made me thoroughly unsatisfied if there was not a sequel (that I will still read), which I feel additionally disturbs the integrity of the novel."
Ulysses,5,"July 20, 2022","However, it is at once a novel that is ambitious in every sense of the word, as it attempts to reimagine a Homerian Odyssey for the modern age. Each of its eighteen chapters is told in different styles that mirror the present circumstances of its protagonists – be it headlines or poems or the evolution of the English language or play scripts or questions and answers, among others. You will pass through every moment with exuberant wordplay and portmanteau expressions that add another layer of nuance to the obscure side of the text. It is also a language installation, hosting verses and lines and paragraphs of untranslated Latin, French, and Italian, leaving us barely any room for subtext while at the same time leaving ourselves to the interpretations. It is a novel packed with allusions to Greek and Irish myths, history, philosophy, language, science, metaphysics, and religion – all purposefully fractured and warped and freewheeled in anti-stream-of-consciousness prose breaking with all manner of literary convention. At every page turn, you are greeted with delightful sights and smells and sounds that are feel foreign yet familiar, believable yet surreal. The noises of Leopold Bloom relieving himself in his outhouse, the vague yet vibrant cityscapes of Dublin, the guttural sounds of cats purring, the sound of spitting on the street, the Kafkaesque transitions from the now to unreality. There are times – a remarkable amount of times – when I’ve found myself laughing out loud, as this book did a brilliant job of highlighting the folly and tragedy of man in such a satirical, lighthearted, comical manner. The out-of-place details, the slow moments, the humorous conversations, the crude jokes."
Ulysses,5,"August 15, 2024","... possibilities is opening up right before me and language is stretching and bending around the corners of the universe - but sometimes it's just difficult and tedious because of the lack of punctuation marks in the Penelope chapter and the sheer length and unapologetic sentences of French that come up and are not explained (though I did feel good about how much of the Latin I was able to translate) - this is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary novels ever written, twisting and bending and saying fuck you to all the literary conventions that kept other authors in such a close chokehold, experimenting, digressing to nothing at all, offering subtle and at other times extremely direct homage and breaking the fourth wall as often as it takes itself so unseriously that it becomes deliriously serious and the Ithaca chapter was so wonderful I wanted to lick the words off my fingernails because who needs a list of words to learn this year when you have a page of Joyce's writing - it felt so deliberate and also delightfully extempore and in a period of crafted novels that draw attention to their intricacies and twists and turns Joyce was able to write his magnum opus about two ordinary men living out less than 24 hours but at the same time they begin a poignant pseudo-father-son relationship and Bloom takes control of his life for the first time and we also glimpse Joyce's dim hope for the future generation through the worries of his self-insert character Stephen Dedalus when he is teaching in the Nestor chapter and Sargent asks for help with his arithmetic and he battles with the apathy, unruliness and restlessness of a generation nestled uncomfortably between the Edwardian and modern times and who had to grapple with war at a very young age, rendering them desensitised to violence from a young age - yes though this novel may seem unplanned that does not detract from the fact that Joyce obviously took time and care crafting the characters and giving them each their own voice even if they never appear at all (one of my favourite presences in the book is Paddy Dignam, a man who has died and whose funeral Bloom attends while he grapples with his own opinions on death, religion and life - and not in a cliched morose Kafkaesque fashion but actually digging deep into passion and everythinf else (can you tell that I find Kafka cumbresome and overpraised?) anyways this novel was frustrating especially because it is essentially one of the most difficult to read in the whole language seriously 16th century poetry is more easily decipherable than this and I'm still not sure whether I like it (I guess with this book it's not really a question of 'like' though is it?) but I am sure that I'll have to revisit it because there's way too much here to absorb in one read when I'm fifteen but is it a good book oh"
cizinec hled byt,4,"March 10, 2024","a nice and easy read, a bit mysterious not something that you have to use your brain for too much. i'd describe its vibes as kafkaesque and dreamy, a lot of what's going on is more abstract than real."
religion for atheists,3,"July 12, 2023","De Botton also seeks refuge, over and over again, in the simplicity and safety of following instruction from a moral authority figure (I would argue that once you have stopped interrogating the world, and started to follow orders blindly, that is where the highest risk of unethical behaviour unfolds). He enjoys didacticism and dislikes nuance and ambiguity - this is not appropriately instructive, he says. Beauty should convey moral good, evil should be evident from ugliness. He also argues that hope is bad, because it gives you unrealistic expectations, and seriously suggests that art museums and universities cannot articulate their own relevance and importance in the cultural sphere, because they are irrelevant, boring, and do not provide ethical instruction - a claim I found absolutely jaw dropping. He advocates that the rigidity of branding and service provision in companies like McDonald’s is a good thing - people get exactly what they expect - and not a kafkaesque outcome of end stage capitalism."
a hologram for the king,3,"December 21, 2017",1. Alan is a Kafkaesque character (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkPR4...) and that character structure enhances the other dichotomies Eggers presents throughout the novel.
a hologram for the king,4,"November 23, 2019","Laced with lots of nostalgic recollections of times gone by to contrast current events, Alan, at least, seems all to aware that he is trapped in a Kafkaesque existence with no escape. His young protégés on the other hand, seemly without insight, are content to drift along, playing on their computers and making out in corners."
a hologram for the king,3,"September 4, 2013","The plot (with *Spoilers*) in a few sentences? Alan, failed businessman, has a last ditch opportunity to make his fortune selling holographic technology to Saudia Arabia. After a series of Kafkaesque bureaucratic failures he succeeds in delivering his pitch, but fails to land the deal when the Saudi king opts to go - as did the rest of American business - with the cheaper Chinese firm. Meanwhile Alan struggles to make sense of his middleage, his failed fatherhood, his frustrated sexuality and his degenerating body: he, like America, is falling apart and ailing."
a hologram for the king,5,"February 15, 2017","So Clay spends time drinking too much and pondering his life. He used to manufacture and sell bikes but outsourced the labour to the Far East. Now he realises that the same thing is happening to him and all the work is moving elsewhere. Things fell into place in the past, the deals came through, but now he finds himself in this Kafkaesque world where nothing is assured and he's not sure what to do."
a hologram for the king,5,"August 1, 2014","This a beautifully constructed book. Literally. The physical book has been designed with care, bound more handsomely than any trade book I've seen, even sewn in signatures. That careful and tactile construction signals what you find as you read: a beautifully built text, gradually revealing the shape and texture of a physical world, a moral landscape, and a human soul. Though its setting becomes increasingly Kafkaesque as the main character, Alan Gray, spends more time in KAEC (King Abdullah Economic City), flashbacks reveal a different protagonist, a different life, a different world."
a hologram for the king,4,"July 4, 2013","I haven't finished reading this book yet, but I am impressed enough to give it a 4 star rating so far. The story gives me a feeling of foreboding; of the absurdity of our modern life with its obsession with profit and with conquering the environment - the story so far is taking place in a development is Saudi Arabia, projected to be a modern city in the middle of a desert. The feeling is Kafkaesque; i am anxious and worried to find out what will happen to Alan Clay, the somewhat bumbling but sympathetic protagonist."
a hologram for the king,4,"May 12, 2013",This is a well written novel. It does describe our current economic world in very Kafkaesque terms. Alan spends the entire novel preparing for a sales meeting that he doesn't stand a chance in. His alienation from the world is every bit as dramatic as the unknown workers he laid off at Shwinn factories. This is a well written short novel that doesn't skimp on anything. I really enjoyed reading it.
a hologram for the king,5,"May 30, 2013",A Kafkaesque ride that reminds of Updike's Rabbit series.
a hologram for the king,5,"August 10, 2012",Beautifully paced; Kafkaesque.
The Autumn of the Patriarch,4,"July 1, 2023","This was a difficult read - it keeps you out with sentences that run across pages, with full stops few and far between. It took a bit of time to get into, but once I realised that this book is effectively a Latin American version of Kafka's 'The Trial', it all clicked. The kafkaesque nature of the unknowable 'El Caudillo' - the general, the stud, the one who gives the orders - parsed through the lens of Márquez's magical realism, is a difficult and complex character. Contemporary Latin America was going through a depressingly similar experience of comic tyrants, so far removed from daily life, except for their violent bounds into reality, are effectively more akin to romanticised figments of collective imagination."
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,5,"May 21, 2025",🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Stars.  THGTTG is hilarious Kafkaesque absurdism for idiots like me. And I suspect you will like it as well.
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,3,"June 28, 2022","This one was a reread from high school, and I definitely liked it a lot more the second time around. Charming and funny without a lot of depth or that memorable of a plot (legitimately the only thing I remembered from my first read was 42), but definitely a great palate-cleanser and a light-hearted read after some of the stuff I've been into of late. A lot more anti-capitalist and anti-cop than I remember, but, hey, you won't hear me complain about it. I love that the Earth was destroyed in the most unceremonious way possible: a Kafkaesque bureaucratic work order that ultimately was not entirely necessary. Absolutely hilarious in the cosmic meaninglessness of it all."
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,4,"October 2, 2022",Or it could be kafkaesque: Government and its Administration make no sense and seem to be there to get you! That is really how this adventure came to pass.
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,4,"February 2, 2021","The first few chapters are absolutely hilarious: a cheerful, kafkaesque series of bureaucratic episodes through which the main character sees his life completely destroyed, only to soon see himself travel through the galaxy on the most improbable of circumstances. He learns that the Earth is not what it seems, and that nonsense seems to rule most of what goes on around the Milky Way."
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,4,"June 29, 2024",Ts is like a Rick and Morty ep the way I didn't understand anything 😭so very Kafkaesque
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,3,"February 6, 2021","This book reminds me greatly of the work of one Jeremy Strong, a man whose works I perused regularly between the ages of maybe ten and twelve; in fact, one of the standout authors of my childhood who really got me into reading. The docile main characters; inexplicable and eccentric alien life and alternative realities; Kafkaesque humour, and dry accessible tone are all very familiar. Similarities noted, I think that perhaps this book would therefore have appealed more so to my ten-year-old brain than my twenty-year-old one."
Death on the Installment Plan,3,"February 1, 2019","In an almost Kafkaesque comedy of errors,this soon turns out to be a self fulfilling prophecy and after being treated like dirt,Ferdinand soon begins mature and respond in kind,before being sent to an English boarding school to hopefully get him to behave."

The Confusions of Young T rless,4,"November 30, 2023","Association within the Kafkaesque, Beckett-ian approach to a much more nihilistic Catcher in the Rye-like prose, synchronous fraternity-like story where Torless embarked upon an endeavour outlooking the vast unredeemable thought processes of youth: the allowance of abuse, of eternal seeking of meanings and purpose, in a very much vicious and barbaric way: persecution and objectification of another flawed human being. Aside from that, it's pretty devastating to see the path of consciousness Torless took that relentlessly diminish along its way: he became rather much a null being, a being who seem to grew apathetic over the countless mental turmoil he prefaced from himself, a self-acceptance that everything is pointless, cease to provide a meaning and thus, bring him to a worthless naught."
Catch 22,5,"December 4, 2013","1. Start with a surrealistic, Kafkaesque worldview basted in chaos;"
Catch 22,4,"November 15, 2021","This Kafkaesque anti-war book features a broad cast of characters all coping with their circumstances in odd ways. And they are all, in their weird ways, kind of endearing and kind of detestable. I don’t know how one can summarize a novel like this adequately, but let’s just say that corruption, war profiteering and forgery are part of this story, as well as love, grief and the very real trauma that many men lived through during this very violent period of history."
Catch 22,5,"June 21, 2015","This book, along with Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, represents some of the most powerful criticism in 20th century American literature, of the military-industrial complex and bureaucracy’s amazing ability to perpetuate itself at the expense of the people it is supposed to serve. It may be rambling and overlong, but the number of priceless quotes and Kafkaesque situations of existential horror distinguish it as one of the great works of post-war fiction."
Catch 22,4,"January 6, 2020","This a Kafkaesque satirical tale of WW2 Air Force flight squadron of bombers on an island in the Mediterranean where all sorts of inverted calamity takes place while conducting acts of war. There's a lively cast of clownish characters and zany plot points of screwballed happenings - think ""Mash"" only goofyier yet still. There's no way Pynchon didn't chew on this book while writing his own screwball WW2 version as ""Gravity's Rainbow"" - Tyrone Slothrop &amp; John Yossarian are two peas of a pod."
Catch 22,3,"February 11, 2024","In addition, Heller’s Kafkaesque presentation of the absurdity of bureaucracy and authority, shown throughout the novel by the generals incompetency yet omnipotence, really strikes through. Yossarian is portrayed as always contending with authority, yet is always brought down by some form of power, similar to K in Kafka’s The Trial."
Catch 22,5,"August 12, 2023","There are lots of words I would use to describe this - absurd, satirical, hilarious, Kafkaesque, incomprehensible. But honestly the one I would choose over all others is astonishing. I don't even know how to describe this book, the ways it made me feel and the things it made me think about. I understand why it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea - there are endless circular conversations and repetitions, and the timeline is all over the place. But the writing is so clever and absurdly funny, the characters so fully fleshed out, and the themes so strong, I enjoyed every moment. I wouldn't classify this as a new favorite by any means, but I do think it's one of the best books I've ever read. It just SAYS something in a way I've never experienced before."
Catch 22,5,"March 6, 2014","Reading it as a teenager, it was perfect anarchy, wildly funny with dazzling wordplay and a Kafkaesque vision of a world gone mad."
Catch 22,5,"January 1, 2025","It took me a while to read I think because of the more episodic feel of it and it's a busy time and yadda yadda but that is also interesting because everyone I picked it up I thoroughly enjoyed it, would be laughing to myself and thinking why don't I pick this up more, the last 150 pages I found very tense and thrilling and a little Kafkaesque BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHABAHABAHAHHHHHAHA"
Catch 22,5,"April 5, 2025","It’s incredible how he maintains all of these emotions while slowly ramping them all up equally, not sacrificing one for the sake of the other. The result is wildly bleak scenes (Yossarian’s final walk through Rome for example) juxtaposed with hilarious events (drunk soldiers not knowing what to do with their convulsing compatriot, and continuously transferring him between the ground and the hood of a car). I’ve never seen a book handle the gross incompetence and Kafkaesque attitude of military bureaucracy in so effortlessly funny of a tone."
Catch 22,5,"May 2, 2024","Catch-22 is now 62 years old (as of writing this), and I can only say that the world has only become more absurd with each passing year; making the logic and insanity of Heller's work age like fine wine. Catch-22 is a surreal, militaristic variant of the Kafkaesque that shatters form and expectation. It's a book that peers into the madness of humanity, the eternal cycle of violence that has tortured each page of human history, and I am madly in love with it."
Catch 22,2,"September 9, 2022","War is hell, and this job does a magnificent job of capturing the madness, immorality, and Kafkaesque nature of it all. The beginning is fantastic and the first few chapters rip along."
Catch 22,3,"January 15, 2020","Entertaining and thought-provoking at times, but also boring and uneven at other points. There is no real camaraderie to serve as a rationale for such a large number of characters and many of the spin-off stories could have been folded into a smaller more humane cast. I also got tired of those catch-22 paradoxes that didn't provide kafkaesque absurdity or illuminate the irrationality of war. A good book, but not the timeless classic it is billed as."
Catch 22,5,"May 26, 2025","A hilarious, kafkaesque fever dream critique of modern warfare and bureaucracy. I love this book."
Catch 22,5,"August 5, 2023","It feels in retrospect kafkaesque, just with mirth to water down the despair."
Catch 22,5,"January 10, 2019","What can I say about Catch-22 that hasn't been said a hundred times? The characters, the mordant humor, the Kafkaesque conundrums, the Escheresque prose! There are many lists of the books that everyone should read but truly this is a clear example - if you haven't yet, you should read Catch-22."
Catch 22,5,"March 2, 2021","Undeniably brilliant, this frantically Kafkaesque story follows a group of indefatigably horny American pilots and officers as they try to avoid their certain deaths as a result of German flak, pointless tragedy, and clerical mishap. Everyone's crazy, so they can go home if they ask, but if they ask, they are proved sane."
Catch 22,5,"February 9, 2025","This war novel is a very clever satire on WW2 and bureaucracy, and it’s teeming with so many surrealistically tragicomic, unabashedly preposterous, but also allegorically nuanced, masterfully poignant and heartbreakingly human elements so eerily steeped in a kafkaesque undertone that it becomes a literary roller coaster ride for the reader."
Catch 22,5,"December 30, 2023","The concept of a catch-22 as initially expressed in this novel is one of the circular logic that a bombardier can be excused from running missions if he's crazy, but to apply for the excuse would be a sane thing to do, and so he will not be excused. And so the term remained within popular English(language)/American(culture) lexicon. I kind of prefer the later idea that ""we are free to do anything to you which you cannot stop us from doing,"" but I guess this is seen as less interesting by everyone else because it's kinda just ""might makes right."" To me, this ""definition"" fits post-Kafka (I always feel ashamed to write ""Kafkaesque"") bureaucratic Hell of Hell-er's (heh) novel a bit better, if not simply because it seems more widespread. Or, put another way, I am more commonly interested in the idea of ""the Individual versus the Horde/Herd/Masses/&amp;c.,"" and it is thus more suitable to say ""the horror of the novel is that Yossarian is but one man, atomized, at odds against the unified body of The Many out to crush him for going against the grain."" Further: Yossarian can hardly fight against the Colonels, as their rank makes them carry more authority, therefore they can slander him, therefore they can convince the American populace back home that he is a scoundrel, therefore Yossarian cannot return home as easily as he'd like. Yossarian cannot fight them, so they must necessarily have the power and permission to subjugate him."
Catch 22,4,"February 2, 2025","At any rate, the guy worked on this book for 10 years. It has a great structure and it's well-thought out, but I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone faint of heart. And besides, one has to work through the somewhat repetitive humor. For a war book, there is surprisingly little ""war action,"" nevertheless, there are macabre moments that give the reader a haunting vision of the cost of war. I was talking with my dad who read it back in the 60s and I was describing one of the more memorable scenes and he instantly knew exactly what I was referring to. He remarked that there are scenes in the book that stay with you. I agree and I think the context of the book is important too. Sure war is hell, but the military bureaucracy that runs things is presented with this kafkaesque, absurd quality, hence the catch 22, that belies the meaning of the violence, i.e. the cost of war. Is it worse to be haunted by great acts of violence, or by the (absurd) justification of them?"
Catch 22,4,"October 3, 2019",The absurdism of war is oftentimes propped up with circular logic resulting in Kafkaesque scenarios.
Catch 22,4,"August 25, 2023","So for me this was less a comic novel (no laughs for me) but rather a serious, sinister, parallel universe psychological horror story. Living in a world of death, self-preservation, self-advancement and perpetual 'non sequitur' logic of even the most obvious societal norms was truly exasperating. This could easily get a Kafkaesque horror movie interpretation."
Catch 22,3,"November 6, 2020","Joseph Heller’s iconic 1961 novel “Catch-22”, whose title has since entered our daily lexicon to convey a paradoxical situation, is a Kafkaesque farce about the collective madness and irrationality of war. Set during the Second World War, it portrays the bizarre experiences of an American air combat squadron based out of a small island called Pianosa off Italy. Many of these are centred on the frustrations of its 28-year-old protagonist—an Assyrian bombardier whose quota of flight missions to be completed before he can return home is abruptly increased each time he comes close to the target. His natural instinct for self-preservation and reason—which compels him to feign injuries, evade dangerous combat operations, and defy authority—make him appear crazy among those who seem to not only rationalise the absurdities of their circumstances, but even thrive in them."
Catch 22,5,"July 9, 2024",This is what I felt when i read this. Some kind of kafkaesque feeling mixed with even more hatred than when you read Amerika or The Process.
Catch 22,5,"September 1, 2022","In many ways, catch-22 is the perfect satirical novel - its incoherence not only is infuriating, but makes complete sense to anyone who has worked under a management team of incompetent self-agrandising egotists, who ""will be the downfall of us all"" as it were. The constant barage of believable insanity is highly entertaining, until slowly, but surely it becomes darker, and more soul destroying, until it is deafeningly crushing. No longer is the satire light and fun, it is a reminder of just how soulless the experience of Kafkaesque nightmares truly are as a reminder of the world that we actually inhabit. But unlike Kafka, Heller offers us hope that we can break out of the vicious absurdity if we take the courage, and possibly equally absurd and reckless step of fighting against stupidity and leaving the situation for greener pastures."
Catch 22,2,"July 1, 2022","That’s not to say this book it without its charms. Heller is clearly brilliant and offers an insider’s criticism of the military. At the same time, I feel he’s trying to be Kafkaesque but instead of one subtle turn of the screw, there are major paradoxes on nearly every page. It makes Catch-22 nigh unreadable. I just can’t recommend this book to anyone unless they’re taking an English class. Beyond that, I’d offer that if this book were 300 pages shorter, I could have been into. Also, I really enjoyed Heller’s “God Knows.”"
Catch 22,3,"October 31, 2017","That said, I found that it got old pretty fast. Yossarian and his comrades are stuck in an absurdist, Kafkaesque world where everyone goes through the motions of using logic, but only as a ridiculous parody or cargo cult, but then it's just kinda that for the whole novel. A bunch of guys run around doing stuff in that world, then the book ends."
Catch 22,2,"July 22, 2020","Everyone that saw me with this book commented what a funny great book it was. Ill say this for context I was digesting the darkness of Dostoyevsky by 8 years old. This was one of the hardest slogs to get through of the thousands of books I've read. I found this a disturbingly dark kafkaesque look at insanity and the true horrific nature of war, the indelible and unheallable mental scars left. As an ex soldier the romantic sheen of army life didn't whisk me away on some crazy adventure, Heller very vividly dictates army life during a war, which is a horrific fucking nightmare. For me the best way to sum this book up is the quote from a Roman General 'the only people that find war attractive are those that haven't seen it'."
Catch 22,4,"December 23, 2023",The writing is very chaotic and introduces many characters like we are living in the camp. There is no plot but presents just a bureaucratic Kafkaesque experience so that was slightly draining. 3.8/5
Catch 22,5,"February 16, 2025","On the surface, Catch-22 is a slapstick, farcical comedy that, like M*A*S*H, veers into the dark realism of war at crucial moments. But the overarching, repetitive source of the absurdity is the Kafkaesque beaurocracy. Whether it's Colonel Cathcart's arbitrary mission allotments, the impossibility of scheduling a meeting with Major Major Major Major (whose name is itself a bungling of paperwork), the inability to remove the belongings of a deal lieutenant who never registered at the base, or the parallel inability to undo the paperwork confirming the death of a doctor who forged attendance on a plane which went down, Catch-22 is perhaps more Kafka than Kafka ever was."
Catch 22,2,"December 12, 2024","I found it a boring, repetitive and dull book. Although there is indeed a sarcastic mockery of the kafkaesque nightmare of human made organizations (in this case, the US military), the book feels like vain intellectual snobery after a few dozens of pages. It is full of catch-22's that keep repeating over and over again as also individual episodes of loosely connected characters. It seems the author was trying to stuff all the available English words of the dictionary in order to hide the lack of substance of the text."
Catch 22,3,"March 8, 2022",The sections that deal with military bureaucracies and the Kafkaesque insanity these young men have to endure is often hilarious.
Catch 22,3,"April 12, 2023",A highly influential book that felt a little dated to me but still had its share of laughs and Kafkaesque nightmares.
Catch 22,5,"July 24, 2024","Surprisingly funny, full of contradictions and oxymorons. Felt a bit odd laughing at this one after crying at grave of the fireflies. Not sure if the humour would translate well, surprised it’s American not British. End sort of reads kafkaesque. Some of the descriptions of women and sex quite dated, but looking passed that it’s overall one of my fav books"
Catch 22,3,"July 14, 2025","I have no idea how to review this book. For the most part, it's as hilarious, brutal, and irreverent as everybody says. The Kafkaesque parable of a sane individual ensnared by the absurdities of mindless bureaucracy will resonate with anyone who has ever called Comcast customer service attempting to reach an actual person, yet alone served as a bombardier in World War II. It gleefully skewers hypocrites, narcissists, bullies, and capitalists. It is both very funny and deeply compassionate. Sometimes the satire is so overblown the effect is cartoonish. Sometimes, the depictions of carnage are so graphic you want to puke."
Catch 22,5,"October 29, 2022",A Kafkaesque war story which somehow is also funny. Heller somehow writes an entire novel without us ever even glimpsing the enemy.
Catch 22,5,"April 1, 2025",The yo-yo of fun…absurdity…dark…back to crazy… to KafkaEsque…”Jesus that’s fucking dark”
Catch 22,4,"February 3, 2013","... conflicted web of human machinery that goes into the execution of war. Heller is not providing some grandiose philosophical inquiry about the evil or goodness of war, but gives a ton of damn good literary pictures of how much the human spirit has to be stretched, refitted, contradicted and knotted up in order to take active part in war. It's all well and good to trumpet the patriotic valor and sacrifice of those who go and fight the war-- but how about the inner-workings of the system that has to breed these warriors and compel them into unthinkable acts of bravery? How much does an individual who has been forced into the savage conditions of warfare, facing the possibility of death every day, really care about the big picture and all the glory which may come of war? Well, Heller goes to great lengths to show how much painstaking and colossal reversals of logic have to be put in place in order to ensure the effective operation of human subjects amidst the devastating chaos of war. Contradictions and machinations of the grossest absurdity are simply part and parcel of orchestrating a successful war effort. In war, all the rules are rewritten in order to manage something which is simply beyond understanding to endure and which assails without mercy any man's instinct for self-preservation. It would be a grossly inaccurate simplification to label Catch-22 as an ""anti-war"" book, despite its well-known appropriation as such by the counterculture of the '60s. Catch-22 is a book of human experience in the face of war and creates a diverse palate of colorful and whimsical characters to inhabit the stage of military operations on the fictional island of Pianosa, Italy as Heller dexterously gives us a portfolio of harrowing, mind-twisting, demoralizing scenarios which the very nature of war engenders. Perhaps war is sometimes a necessary evil, perhaps it can highlight and nurture the very noblest and most praiseworthy of mankind's glories-- Heller never contradicts these ideas. What he does do, however, is shows us what else war is, besides the obvious onslaught of horror and bloodshed, the other aspects which perhaps war must be as long as it requires the commitment and participation of people, made up of flesh and blood, feelings, thoughts, desires, fears, etc. Perhaps war itself is not necessarily just a Kafkaesque nightmare constructed by delusion, falsehood, nationalistic pride, and empty hopes-- but in the experience of those who have to do the fighting, the ones who have to risk their lives every day and take part in missions which could obliterate them in a split-second-- perhaps it appears that way. In the purview of Heller's Catch-22, we see how despite whatever else war may be, war is also very much the embodiment of a mass hysteria, a nefarious machine of political terror which relies on coercion, paradox, insufferably mind-bending rules and impossible perversions of logic in order to forge and churn out the individual instruments of warfare-- the soldiers, that is."
Catch 22,5,"June 5, 2019","The essence of the book is its paradox, a Kafkaesque premise that is played for more obvious comedy, an almost vaudevillian, Borscht Belt humor, with a rapid-fire verbal exchange between characters who never operate from the same set of suppositions, where, in essence, everyone sees everyone else as crazy. Heller is able to throw together this disparate bunch of characters—all with conflicting personal goals/motives—and have them bounce bizarrely off each other because they are in a thick fog of war. Add to this infrastructural elements (bureaucracy and black marketeering), and military objectives/events are even further distorted."
Catch 22,3,"February 27, 2017","I have been befuddled and bewildered by messy timelines before, but this is the first time that I felt it was both planned and fitting. I haven't read Kafka, but this book is what I'll think of whenever I hear ""Kafkaesque"". I think it was cleverly designed and readable and an excellent window into the nightmare of administrative wartime cruelties, but I was grateful to reach the end."
Catch 22,5,"February 23, 2017","Catch-22 also has some Kafkaesque elements, in the sense that the hyperbolic absurdity is both hilarious and frightening because of its realness."
Catch 22,5,"December 4, 2014","The story is highly repetitive, but in a unique way. You are going to hear a lot of points of view, often confusing and mind-blowing. But just like Inception, stick with it. Accept that Heller is a genius and our not as intelligent minds will eventually catch up to his logic. Or not. It's really funny either way. Seriously...these people who make absurdity, surrealist, Kafkaesque mastery so hilarious...I applaud you. I love laughing at the insane and tragic realities we are all put in."
Catch 22,4,"September 4, 2016","I'm surprised it's so often assigned reading in highschools; it's far more modern than I had expected, and I can see how it must have influenced American postmodernism greatly. I suppose English teachers figure that teenagers can relate to the cynicism and rebellion in the book; but it seems to me that I would never have understood any of the ideas of mortality and companionship. And I certainly wouldn't have believed that every exaggerated Kafkaesque moment of bureaucracy could happen in real life. But now I can, so this book might have come just at the right time."
Catch 22,5,"June 8, 2025","It’s V.’s brother in essence. The main difference I can think of is just that V. doesn’t even have a plot. One could maybe even draw a line of comparison between this and John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces. Heller’s Catch-22 is a fantastic novel with arguably the most recognizable and also best book cover of all time, riddled with geeky Kafkaesque satire and a cast of characters that is both expansive but also incredibly endearing. I’ve heard a good book is one that makes you laugh one page and cry the next and Catch-22 might be the embodiment of such a phenomenon. The book’s been hailed as a masterpiece by everyone and their grandma but usually their grandma as kind of the crown jewel of post-wwii (funny given the fact the book takes place during World War Two) American fiction you don’t read in high school. The fact you might need to look up a timeline to understand this book on a chronological level isn’t super devastating to its quality, although I’m not even gonna pretend I don’t think I owe it more rereads in the future. Snark is probably my favorite character despite how little he shows up, Orr probably being a close second. The interaction between Cathcart and Milo towards the end is really really funny. Point being, for a ~450 book, it doesn’t feel exhausting or boring at any point. Deserves its status, I’d say."
Catch 22,4,"January 1, 2016","It had been on my list for quite a while now and I very happy I actually got to it - It is one of the books about war I've appreciated most, as it manages to be very human, brutal and occasionally hopeful at the same time. Yes, there is gore and there is death and there are some Kafkaesque situations that made me want to punch certain characters (you'll probably know which as you read)."
Catch 22,3,"May 23, 2015","I first tried reading the book about two years ago and dropped it after about 50 pages. I now tried listening it, which has worked out quiet well. This is the best book to put in the background and tune in and out: none of it is in order, the plot is Kafkaesque with a multitude of characters panning and zooming. Yet it is full of clever absurdities and interesting observations to keep those rare tune ins justified. I didn't even notice when the book was over it ended so abruptly. Hurrah to me for finishing this (in the best sense of the word) nonsense."
Catch 22,4,"December 6, 2013","Absolutely, ridiculously hilarious and a whole new kind of “war is hell” book, showing war as an absurd Kafkaesque nightmare. Almost like bureaucracy gone way, way too far. A surrealistic tour-de-force of mass madness/hysteria. Unnerving, quirky and terribly amusing. It takes a bit too much time to get through it all at times and it is slightly flawed but there is still so much goodness here. Those of us whole love Monty Python might find themselves feeling right at home with this one."
Catch 22,5,"July 22, 2014","A real classic, Catch-22 offers more than a mere insight into the coined pop-culture term. It's an absurd, almost Kafkaesque story set during WWII that has almost nothing to do with the actual war. Other than ""relax and enjoy"", I have no words of caution, as this novel is truly a journey that must be taken to be understood."
Catch 22,5,"December 5, 2013","If only there were ten stars to give this novel. Kafkaesque, hilarious, heart-wrenching, relateable characters who are just as absurd as you are. What more could you want in a novel?"
Catch 22,4,"February 6, 2018","Feels like a trip. Funny, scary, kafkaesque."
Catch 22,4,"May 12, 2020",Depressingly Kafkaesque while simultaneously whimsically ridiculous. Entertaining throughout. The audiobook performance by Jay Sanders is excellent.
The Complete Stories and Poems,3,"November 13, 2017","The recurring themes of isolation (internment is the extremest form) in the short stories becomes workmanlike and formulaic. The detailed crime/mystery stories like Murders on the Rue-Morgue make me think today Poe would have a CSI-like series on cable. How, the Pit and the Pendulum retains a disorienting, interesting Kafkaesque flair."
The Goalie s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,4,"August 25, 2019","This is much more of a Kafkaesque refusal. An example of how lost in language Bloch is, but juxtaposed against a legalese in which he cannot share (thus emphasizing his isolation):"
The Goalie s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,3,"September 17, 2021","Interesting Kafkaesque psychological novel. Though writing style can be discussed, what bothered me more is the shallowness of all other characters except the main one. Furthermore, the main character could be depicted better. We learn zero about his previous life, apart from that he used to be a goalkeeper and has ex wife."
Two Serious Ladies,4,"July 21, 2024",An extraordinary book. Strange and rather surreal. Dialogue and events are almost Kafkaesque.
Bartleby the Scrivener,5,"November 6, 2019","I've heard about this book back in high school or first year of university when my good friend was all hyped up about it, but only now did I finally sit down to actually read it. Given that the author is Melville (and I was never a fan of Moby Dick), I didn't expect to like the story as much as I did - at the beginning the writing style seemed pretty dense and I found it hard to follow his ideas, but eventually I finished reading it in one, okay, two sittings (with a TV show break). Even though the story is about a man, who, basically, step by step, gave up on his life, at some points it was so funny that I even laughed out loud. Re: ""hot and spicy"". The absurdity very much reminded me of Gogol's storytelling, the office life had kafkaesque undertones and if I'm getting into the free flow of associations, the video to Just by Radiohead pops into my mind. I have a feeling that I'll keep on pondering the complexity of Bartleby's character for many years to come. Feels like I can be generous with 5 stars once in a while."
Bartleby the Scrivener,4,"February 20, 2022","A distinctly Kafkaesque feeling haunts the story after the first few “I would prefer not to” phrases are delivered. (Of course, Kafka was yet to be born some thirty years later.) Intense and intensifying as the narrative progresses and Bartley withdraws to an untouchable place of sheer apathy. As a critique of humanity, this story could be made to apply today — how we withdraw, preferring not to change anything, not to leave our room, not to stop staring at the wall (screen?) all day long. The conclusion would be cynical, fatalistic, we’re it not for the narrator, who represents another aspect of humanity, humane to a greater degree, though seemingly incapable, despite its best effort, to resolve the problem of withdrawal and “preferring not to”. In a sense, the narrator is likewise accepting of the situation and prefers not to engage with it until it is really pressing and his own reputation is at stake. Too little, perforce, too late. Hopeless/helpless on the one side; inscrutable/apathetic on the other. Who would have thought such a tension could creat an intoxicating narrative? (But I’m glad it is over.)"
Bartleby the Scrivener,4,"June 21, 2021","No expectations but a beautiful little story. Never forget that Melville's prose is certainly among the best of his era. There are all sorts of readings here - this is Melville so of course, we have a queer reading available, and more generally a psychoanalytic one. Bartleby is a Kafkan parable - that is - not Kafkaesque, but adhering to Kafkan framing, his love for incongruity sunk into congruity, thereby neutralising the congruous. Perhaps."
Bartleby the Scrivener,4,"July 4, 2020","This story has such a kafkaesque vibe that if I didn't know it was written by Melville, I'd believe the author was Franz Kafka. Of course, it was Melville who inspired Kafka but I didn't know Melville had a similar ironical approach in his works. Bartleby's ""I would prefer not to"" sounds like 19th century Rage Against the Machine's ""F*ck you, I won't do what you tell me"". I couldn't help but think of this song while reading it. Woops."
Bartleby the Scrivener,4,"September 10, 2023","The narrator is a lawyer who hires Bartleby as a copyist in his Wall Street office to join the two already temperamental copyists. Bartleby turns out to not be the compliant employee the lawyer might have been hoping for. I must admit that I didn’t get much from the initial reading and had to think deeply quite a long time before starting to feel I had some understanding of the story and even I am little convinced that others would agree. For me, it is not insignificant that the story takes place on Wall Street, the financial center of the Capitalist world. Nor it is insignificant that the workers in the office are engaged in the alienating task of copying other’s documents. Further to this, that the workers have found themselves in a role that is not comfortable with their life clock with one only functioning fine until midday and another only after midday. That is my take on the setting in which I get to understand Bartelby, the man who would prefer not to do whatever is asked of him. Worth reading for the puzzle it presents and its Kafkaesque feel of the short story even before Kafka came into existence. Very short and worth reading."
Bartleby the Scrivener,1,"December 8, 2021","It’s a strange little thing. It feels proto-Kafkaesque while you’re reading it. The advantages of reading it are that it’s short and you can say you’ve read it. Then you can wink at people and say, “I’d rather not.” These are the only, and entirely insufficient, reasons I can think of for making the effort."
Bartleby the Scrivener,2,"September 28, 2023","*Novelette, which I found quite Kafkaesque in plot &amp; tone."
Bartleby the Scrivener,5,"June 15, 2017","A thoroughly unpredictable story, and uncannily prescient. A proto-Kafkaesque story, minus the surrealism, and a little more unsettling than usual since it achieves a similar, if not identical effect."
Bartleby the Scrivener,3,"May 28, 2020","I have mixed feelings about this book. It's humane in the sense that it really annoys me like a person would sometimes. it has a kafkaesque (however you spell it) feel to it but end in a Dostoevsky way, which is mind-boggling."

Bartleby the Scrivener,5,"January 8, 2022","Yeah, Kafkaesque enough for me to read"
Bartleby the Scrivener,4,"December 28, 2010",A strange and intriguing short story. I love how it's bizarre yet so matter-of-fact. Very Kafkaesque.
dune,5,"January 11, 2015","I love, love, love this series. I have read them many times. Heroes, baddies, spies, adversary. All the ingredients of an epic saga done up as sci-fi. I usually read the first three books: Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune every few years. A Kafkaesque tale if ever there was one. Read it, enjoy and reflect on our blue planet and our waste."
severance,4,"March 24, 2020","The mindless routine of the fever victims was also striking. It too seemed to be a commentary on the Kafkaesque nature of capitalism. Sometimes Candace wonders if she herself is fevered. What really is the difference between an office drone going through a routine and a fevered person pursuing repetition to the point of physical and mental disintegration? There is a difference, but it may be more of a sliding scale rather than a strict dichotomy."
The Elephant,3,"December 21, 2019","The Elephant  is a collection of short, surreal, absurdist and often Kafkaesque stories from 1950s Communist Poland. Amusing, witty and highly satirical — so much so that some stories require repeated reading and may still end in uncomprehension — this slim volume lays humourous ground for an understanding of life under totalitarianism (indeed, the humour of these stories paves way for a realisation of the horrors of lived reality). While I found myself unable to properly appreciate some of the stories, I liked many and thoroughly enjoyed ""Children"", ""Peer Gynt"" and ""The Chronicle of the Besieged City""."
blackass,4,"March 8, 2016","Furo, a 33-year-old, unemployed Nigerian man who still lives at home with his parents and younger sister, wakes up one morning to find that he has experienced a Kafkaesque transformation: he is an oyibo, a white man. Mystified and frightened of what his family will think, he runs away from home before they can see him."
blackass,3,"May 30, 2016","Not as kafkaesque as promised, but an insightful look into modern Nigerian culture."
blackass,3,"January 17, 2018","I found the book alright despite its very Kafkaesque setting. Despite the very vivid description of city culture of Lagos, I found the book lacking in terms of character development and it's inability to go deeper into the themes that it wanted to reflect on such as Nigerian obsession with skin color and oyibos. Though it's an easy read, I feel it could have been a lot more better and complex."
The Trial,4,"February 14, 2012","Unfortunately…Stupid, which happened more often, would occur when that next Kafkaesque lesson would bounce off my thick head, making me lose my tenuous foothold and go sliding back down Mount Ignorance. It was a difficult summit to reach and I was I'll-equipped."
The Trial,5,"June 1, 2025","The word Kafkaesque sends an eerie feeling across your spine on the haunting thought of delving into world of Franz Kafka, the unexpected and unusual expectations make your heart throb with excitement and anxiousness on speculating the vast range of possibilities which might come across your way. We know that freedom lies at the center of our existence, for we long for free will and therefore to make choices in our lives. The nihilistic attitude towards life tells us that life is inherently meaningless and absurd, however, we must accept the inherent condition of life and become absolutely free to define purpose of our life and thereby take responsibility to live according to it. However, what would happen if the oppressing force of bureaucracy robs us off our freedom, our free will as if our very freedom is restricted by social machinery of bureaucracy which may attribute the feeling of futility and nothingness to our consciousness. It may appear to be a bleak and dark world but that’s the world of Kafka, The Trial."
The Trial,4,"May 15, 2024","But if your goal, à la my own, is simply to be able to use the word ""Kafkaesque"" whenever your little heart desires, you can read this, draw on your memories of the two times you've read The Metamorphosis in school, and be on your merry way."

The Trial,4,"April 9, 2011",Kafka's Trial is one of those books that are always present in cultural sphere and referenced ad nauseum. Despite never having read Kafka before I am quite sure I used the word 'Kafkaesque' on many occasions and maintained a semi-eloquent conversation about 'The Trial'.
The Trial,3,"January 16, 2018","I’ve read many theories that address the metaphors to be found in “The Trial” and while I think they are fun to think about (the German word for trial is the same word they would use for “process”, so maybe the book is about an internal psychological process; the arrest is on the morning of K.’s thirtieth birthday, so maybe this is about the endless complications of adulthood; life is just a series of senseless trials and tribulations… I could go on, but you get the idea), I also didn’t enjoy the experience of reading this book enough to indulge in them too much. It was a fast and easy read, and while I am aware that it meandered and droned on completely deliberately, to put the reader in K.’s head, I was glad to get it over with. I still think it belongs on my “mandatory reads” shelf, if only because this book is so seminal, and referred to ad nauseum in both literature and pop culture: you need to read this so you can be obnoxiously accurate when you declare that something is Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"July 21, 2015","Ever since first reading this novel in school, I've assumed the word ""Kafkaesque"" described an aspect of society analogous to living under a totalitarian state."
The Trial,5,"February 22, 2024","What makes The Trial a quintessentially Kafkaesque book? Why does it still appeal to us? Stripped bare of its adornments, it is a story of Josef K.’s struggle against an unknown tyrannical force and the inescapable clutches of a faceless bureaucracy. However, it’s much more than that. It deals with themes of religion, estrangement, judgment, guilt, absolutism and helplessness. Kafka is notoriously difficult to pin down. The arbitrariness with which the system of justice operates in The Trial, has a deceiving - albeit fleeting - resemblance to ordinary-everyday life. But this resemblance is transitory. It’s elusive. Just when you thought you understood what’s going on, Kafka lapses into obscurity again."
The Trial,5,"July 7, 2015","Before I started rereading The Trial it was my intention to compose one of my pastiche reviews for it. My thought was that the above situation, i.e. being harangued by policemen who want to investigate a crime that you yourself don’t want them to investigate, a crime that you doubt has even been committed, was suitably absurd and Kafkaesque [I hate that word!]. To some extent I mourn the loss of that review; it would have been fun to write. The reason that I didn’t continue any further than the opening paragraph is that I found, to my surprise, so much to say about the book. I tend to compose those pastiche reviews when I am dealing with something that either didn’t inspire me to think too much or that has been poured over and analysed to the point that it becomes impossible to say anything new or even interesting about it. Now, I don’t claim that my take on The Trial is completely original, but I certainly found that it wasn’t the book I remembered it being, that the most commonly discussed aspects are underpinned by, I would argue, more compelling themes that commentators often ignore or do not give sufficient weight to."
The Trial,5,"August 4, 2016","Many moments made me laugh, some left me suspended in strangeness, a dream-like fictional reality mimicking a surreal or perhaps borderline-insane reality. A few times my heart dropped to my belly, like when you ride a roller coaster. I mouthed the words to myself that I’ve heard define “Kafkaesque” – “That’s really creepy.”"

The Trial,5,"March 30, 2022","There exists a canon of works that will be devoured, analysed, dissected, worshipped, exalted, and looked upon with trepidation and awe until either the end of time, or until the end of all that humans have lived for since the Beginning. The Trial is incredibly special, and for this reason it has rightfully cemented its place in this holy canon. It evokes a feeling that is so unique and potent that no existing word is good or accurate enough to describe it. For this reason the epithet 'Kafkaesque' has been created—a word that has been shamefully overused and shamefully misunderstood. ‘Kafkaesque’, in its literal sense, is a term used to describe something that is unsettling and oppressive, something horrifying that hides behind the mundane—an impending doom, that, once set in motion, cannot be stopped no matter how one may grapple with it. It is the peculiar feeling of an urge to, despite the horror, laugh at the absurdity of what is unfolding. But what about the name, and even more importantly, the person bearing the name, that is attached to the suffix? What about Franz Kafka the PERSON? What is unique about him?"
The Trial,2,"October 30, 2015","I would like to clarify a few things here. I got the allegories alright, but I prefer Dostoevsky's version of them rather than Kafkaesque, not because they are more direct but because they always left me satisfied, along with the other common emotions of wretchedness and pity. Kafka here leaves so many questions open that I can't help but wonder if he wanted to even give a direction. For example: He ended a chapter in the middle of the scene(I'm sure I missed something there); in the last chapter, The Cathedral, the priest illustrates a story to our protagonist and after a lot of consideration and analysis, he concludes that it's eventually up to one's volition how, or if, they want to interpret it(Again, I might be wrong here, but hey, opinion!). Which sums the book up for me."
The Trial,3,"December 30, 2017","Rating a book like this is almost impossible. This is the book that made ""Kafkaesque"" a concept. The main character is Joseph K, who finds himself arrested for an unspecified crime. He is allowed to live at home and continue to work, but knowing there is a process being mounted against him in a non-judicial court. He engages a lawyer on recommendation from an uncle. This seems to only make things worse."
The Trial,5,"April 15, 2020","Tác phẩm này là một trong nhiều cuốn đại diện cho chủ nghĩa Kafkaesque quá quen thuộc trong dòng văn của Kafka.

The Trial,4,"December 2, 2014","The adjectival tribute to the author, ""Kafkaesque"" hearkens to this novel in particular, as a representation of the ""nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality"" of much of Kafka's larger oeuvre, with a particular emphasis on the application to bureaucracy. In fact, a suiting, though less abundantly ironic, subtitle for this novel could be as easily ""Schreckgespenst,"" or ""Nightmare"" - as the blend of the surreal and macabre, routine and disruption, and recursive reduction to the absurd creates an haunted dreamscape for the reader. Reinforcing this idea of a dream, or nightmare, is that, like in Kafka's The Metamorphosis, the initial enigmatic action is foregone, and the result is thrust upon our confused protagonist as he is jarred from sleep: ""Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested."" Note the parallel to ""One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible insect."" Are the horrifying and unusual occurances of these stories merely bad dreams, a second layer down, a ""dream within a dream""? Or is waking life the horrid dream, of which sleep is a fleeting escape? The Trial is not explicit, though it seems to indicate the validity of both, with the nihilistic cynicism of the latter."

The Trial,2,"February 28, 2008","This may be the strangest book I have ever read. What can I say - it was Kafkaesque! I never knew what the trial was about, but I always thought it was about, well, a trial. It turns out - and I'm not spoiling it for you, because this is clear in the beginning - that Josef K. doesn't know what the trial is about either."
The Trial,5,"June 7, 2015",2.	A better understanding of the term Kafkaesque.
The Trial,1,"June 2, 2011","I opted to read this because I feel like a well-educated adult so read all books that are part of the cultural lexicon, and so I should read at least one thing by the author who inspired the term ""Kafkaesque."" So I read it. And, God help me, I finished it, but I will never get that month of my life back."
The Trial,4,"December 13, 2023","I thought it was fascinating to see how Kafka captures the essence of such a man slowing losing himself, dealing with a seemingly perpetual event that's mentally taxing. The whole book had a certain dreamlike quality to it, realistic and unrealistic at the same time, leaving you with lots to ponder about. The long-term anxiety, the suffocation that K felt literally and figuratively, it was all very palpable and masterfully written. Besides the oppression, it also signifies how far humans will go fighting injustice in their own ways, even when the majority may succumb to pressure. We all are defendants in various trials that may or may not be official in life. It does feel nihilistic somewhat with resistance being futile and K dying without attempting to escape, but I can't deny that it was such a captivating journey that had me questioning the vagaries of life. The only thing I found somewhat distasteful was K's uncanny ability to woo the women at first sight and the disjointed structure of the narrative, but the latter is understandable considering it's unfinished material. Anyway, I finally have an inkling about the term 'Kafkaesque' and I look forward to reading his other works in the near future. 🙂"
The Trial,4,"October 4, 2014","The story of The Trial epitomises something that is Kafkaesque, a world of little hope, much despair and small men pitted against the power of a state. Written in German, Kafka always called the book Der Process, but it was changed to The Trial in translation. It was written in 1914 but not published until a year after his death in 1925. Kafka used his own exhausting experiences of a legal case to inform the novel."
The Trial,5,"January 3, 2016","The Trial is a prophecy on the insanity of modern bureaucracy. This Kafkaesque work has surrealism like dreamy convulsing scenes, a condemnation of the intractable Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy-which Kafka, ensconced as he was in the State's insurance establishment, knew well."
The Trial,4,"May 14, 2018","The Trial by Franz Kafka, which he wrote in early 20th century, Prague is an unnecessary complicated and frustrating experience that deals with mundane and absurd aspects of modern bureaucracy that Kafka drew from his experience as an insurance clerk. This book totally explains the term Kafkaesque. Not only the absurdity of bureaucracy is explained in this book but it also deals with how this character Josef K react to the situations he presented with and his logical reasoning that give rise to those reactions."
The Trial,4,"May 15, 2017","Franz Kafka’nın insan hayatını mecazi bir şekilde satırlara döktüğü “Dava / The Trial / Der Process”, insanın olgunluğa eriştiği anda kendini bitmez tükenmez dertlerin içinde bulduğu bir hayat davasına başladığını etkileyici ve depresif bir dille okuyucuya sunuyor. Atmosferi ve sürreal yapısıyla tam bir Kafkaesque olarak adlandırılabilecek eseri okurken başlarda hikayeye odaklanmak oldukça zor. Ama okudukça kabul edilmesi zor Kafka atmosferi içinize işlemeye başlıyor ve hikayeye daha kolay adapte oluyorsunuz. Hayatın dert dolu sıkıntılı bir yol olduğunu oldukça boğucu bir dille anlatan Kafka’nın hayatı insanların ölümü bekledikleri bir hapis olarak resmetmesi oldukça korkutucu. Okunmadan önce Montaigne’in “Denemeler” başyapıtının okunmasını şiddetle öneririm."
The Trial,5,"February 10, 2016","(If you’re ever in Prague by the way, make sure to check out The Franz Kafka Museum. A lot more thought and imagination has gone into it than is sometimes the case with these writer’s exhibitions. The use of video displays and sounds really does try to bring to life the Kafkaesque experience. To give an idea of its strengths, a friend of mine said, as we came out: “I knew nothing about Kafka this morning, now I’m quite interested in the man.”)"
The Trial,2,"July 28, 2018","It feels that I am missing something when I scroll down through other reviews, and have to scroll down for a minute to find anything less than 4 stars. It is not that I do not recognise Kafka's unique writing style, in the sense of the themes used: authority, identity, absurdism, alienation, and these were beautifully worked into the text. It is just that the book did not feel ""Kafkaesque"", there was no mood created in the novel that impacted me in the same way that The Metamorphosis made me feel small and disgusted, or fearful. In 'The Trial' the reader is not left in such a tone, but frustrated, due to the ignorance of the main character. The book became less awful when after 176 pages it was finally revealed that the crime which our protagonist had part-taken in was legally not allowed to be told to him. This made his actions seem more futile where before they seemed insolent. His complacency in his dilemma did not portray a man that struggles under the ties of bureaucracy, but simply an arrogant man who saw all people beneath him, (I loved how almost every female character seem to want him, which only feeds his arrogance all the more). Because of this every character he meets (for only 4-5 pages) (who represents a different part of the legal system), has barely any bearing on the story, because the protagonist is completely complacent in his actions."
The Trial,4,"December 1, 2021",i’m legally allowed to use the word kafkaesque now
The Trial,4,"October 17, 2017","The Schocken edition is much more lyrical and readable than any other I have tried. The power of the novel remains the same, whatever the edition. In this second, more careful, reading I became aware of how methodically scenes are set by Kafka. We have heard a lot about something being Kafkaesque, be it absurd or spooky or nightmarish, but nothing explains the word better than this novel. He wrote from a position of great pain, and his work may be the most symbolic and powerful confessional literature out there. The desire is to not talk about the immediate pain to defuse it in some story. But the raw material, with the help of an extraordinary subconsciousness, is used to construct allegories that have universal consequence. The familial orbit of Metamorphosis has been transformed into an absurd bureaucratic hell, but the tools remain the same - guilt, shame, nothingness, and a relief to be squashed like a bug."
The Trial,5,"February 9, 2017","First time reading Kafka. Not the last time reading Kafka. I've read ""The Trial"" totally for 6 hours, and for these hours, I was myself Kafka. What about the author? He had completely different mode of thinking. Was it unfamiliar? No. Waiting to see resemblance with George Orwell, I have found absolutely individual Kafkaesque ambiance. Even I finished book yesterday, I couldn't find enough courage for writing review. Still questioning myself: ""Did I catch the point? Maybe I overlooked substantial parts?"" All in all, it is time to share personal feels about The Trial. The protagonist, Josef K., is rational character in absurd world. He was the symbol of rigidity, who preferred to lose all his achievements, even (attention: spoiler!) his existence, instead of slaving for The Court of Law ""like a dog"". His process was exactly opposite to Block's process, who chose to become dependent on court, ruin business, but stay alive. That is what made Josef K. distinguish. He clearly showed that he was still FREE even court put hands on him."

The Trial,4,"July 16, 2022","Some of the greatest stories, especially ones containing the most thought-provoking topics, are often better left unfinished, and Kafka's brusque collection of works are amongst the most poignant of them all, leaving the reader with much more than she/he could have asked for. What is exceptional about the Trial is not only the brilliant mystification and irrationality of everything that happens in it (the Kafkaesque portions), but how clairvoyant it all seemed to be in its time. Little could Kafka know how in only twenty years time, Germany would fall under the Nazi regime, yet how similar the seemingly farcical agents in the Trial appear to represent the Gestapo, and the totalitarian state which is so elusive and abstruse can be compared to Hitler's unethical rule. Now I don't believe that Kafka directly foresaw the ascension of Adolf Hitler, but what he did perceive was the general course of a increasingly static, tortuous and duplicitous bureaucracy. The reason why this novel functions best as a dystopic nightmare is that it represents society at its worst, but it's scary how real it is."
The Trial,3,"March 23, 2015","While rereading this book truly brings home the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" it has to be taken as the surrealist novel of political commentary it is, rather than as a novel."
The Trial,3,"July 16, 2017","And at last I arrive at the end of my review. I am not an expert of Kafkaesque, but to me, the best way to read Kafka is to stop finding any hidden meanings or trying to interpret his cryptic sentences, until the very end. Because believe it or not, the bizarre atmosphere he created is definitely not absent of logic or reason, it’s just that his angles and perspectives are unique. But the story to me, was fully devoid of hope. A book I shall never forget."
The Trial,4,"October 18, 2016","Strong points: Kafka was a master of the absurd, and The Trial is the masterpiece. There is no wonder that Kafka's writing has inspired the term ""Kafkaesque"", used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work. Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical. Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction."
The Trial,4,"June 28, 2015","Reading this book feels very much like visualising a bizarre dream; and I love reading Kafka the same way some of us perversely enjoy our nightmares; the deep thrill of experiencing the surreal and unknown, and the challenge of trying to interpret and make sense of the madness. At the same time also there’s an immense, calming relief when waking up from a strange dream, a relief that it’s not your own reality; this luxury, however, is never afforded the inhabitants of a Kafkaesque world."
The Trial,4,"November 11, 2009","What was Kafka writing about? His own life, in which he was trapped in the perceived misery of the routine ritual of the office worker? The strained, complex relationship between Central European Jewish father and son, a rich palette of disappointed aspirations and misunderstood expectations? The undercurrent of animosity that inflected the ethnic German populace from an alien Jewish minority that prospered in their midst? The binds and constraints placed upon an increasingly hypocritical and decadent society by its moral precepts and ethical values? The conflicts between the burgeoning rationalism of modernity and the spiritual yearnings and trappings of the elder culture? Glimpses at the totalitarian inevitability of the marriage of a faceless bureaucracy with the full-power of the modern state? One can read many things into this work which, along with the delightful style of Kafka's writing, explains its enduring popularity. For myself, the story needed a touch more fleshing out, and a deeper penetration of K.'s travails with his hidden persecutors, to be completely satisfying; as it stands, it is still an outstanding introduction to the technocratic immolation of the Kafkaesque"
The Trial,5,"March 19, 2015","What an interesting journey inside Kafka's absurd reverie; the existential tale that is, like great books, highly controversial and can be interpreted on many levels. The Kafkaesque surrealism and absurdity were quite gripping to say the least with their uncommon characters inside a bureaucratic totalitarian state in the modern industrial age. The novel is about the bleak tale of the protagonist, Josef K., who is caught in a labyrinth of incomprehensible circumstances after being prosecuted with a charge that he knows nothing about in a bureaucratic legal system that virtually no one knows for sure how it works. The story follows his futile efforts to prove his innocence and meanwhile we encounter the other secondary characters with their peculiar behaviour and surreal conversations. There are quite numerous interpretations for this nightmarish story; political, economical, and even religious explanations, for example, the trial might represent life itself, where we are under-arrest trying all the time to understand its meaning and escape our verdicts, the lawyer who claims to know the inner-workings of the court might represent religion in this sense and so on. The story also depicts the desperate life of the common people, and their fear, weakness, and inability which are by-products of the modern industrial age where fear of losing jobs controls peoples' lives."
The Trial,4,"September 17, 2010","Kafkaesque, as defined by Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (Tenth Edition) refers to “having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre or illogical quality”. Franz Kafka’s novel, The Trial, is the ultimate Kafkaesque story; the original (written before his death in 1924); the story that gave coinage to the word. As for its contribution on the whole, this novel, for its nightmarish narrative and bizarre plot, is considered a forerunner in existential literature."
The Trial,2,"December 31, 2020","And I think if we go with that message then, yes, the prose style of many words not going anywhere, of characters continuously confused with what they are thinking or doing with their bodies, the 'dreaminess' of Kafka's prose, it all fits very well. The lapse in moral values is from idleness, the slow nightmare is the inability for us to fight against persecution. Kafka is not writing a nightmare, but an unpleasant dream, and for me 'Kafkaesque' is when surreal unpleasant dreamy bewilderment accompanies senseless punishment that seems to conflict with metaphysical 'good' ideal values like justice. So yes, given that, I can see why Kafka is acclaimed."
The Trial,5,"December 6, 2013","I remember, correctly, that Welles' version is fairly loyal to the book, and that the movie includes ""Kafkaesque"" visual touches that make the film surreal instead of mundane (especially one scene where tons of arms are coming out of gaps through the walls, which fits the tenor of the book, but not really). One surprise is that I remember Joseph K. as being a milquetoast shy boy. I remember that Joseph K. is a bit of a dick in Welles' movie, but figured that had more to do with Welles, not with Kafka. But nope. K. is a bit of a womanizing dick. Joseph K. is cocky and sure of his intellect; he's confident about his business acumen, and knows that he is seductive and quick. He expects to be in control; looks down on others; thinks he's smarter than everyone; and assumes he can manipulate who he wants. K. thinks he's smarter than his boss, and thinks he can handle the law system on his own. Kinda not what I remembered at all."
The Trial,5,"January 26, 2025","Only 90% into the book did I realize how thoroughly I’ve been swallowed by Franz Kafka’s world. Once finishing the Trial, the definition of Kafkaesque became hauntingly clear. What this story says not just about justice but the world at large has become more and more relevant to me. Although I do have issues with this book, it is the only medium I have encountered (maybe next to the film After Hours but that is slightly different) that is able to so capture this indescribable feeling so perfectly. I would have loved to go into this completely blind and without the ending spoiled but that didn’t take away from Kafka’s story one bit."

As he struggles to understand what led to this situation, he only entangles himself further in an inexorable maze from where escape seems unfeasible. Taking place in classic Kafkaesque setting, the story spans an entire year of the trial. While progressing through claustrophobic spaces, strange characters, and near-surrealist events, our protagonist comes to face the terror and ultimate unpredictability of human life in an almost dystopian and nightmarish atmosphere."
The Trial,4,"December 17, 2014","This is the tale of Joseph K, a respected Chief clerk in a bank who is suddenly arrested and must defend his innocence against a charge about which he can get no information, from anyone other than those peripheral to the coury that has issued the charge. This mounting absurdity, this increasing pressure on Jospeh K is the origin of the adjective 'Kafkaesque'. He is never told what he is on trial for, he never sees the trial documents, and when he says he is innocent, he is immediately asked 'innocent of what'?"
The Trial,5,"November 22, 2023","Now I understand what ""Kafkaesque"" means. Such bizarre storytelling. Like in a dream. Like the events that lead up to a jumpscare or a realisation in a horror movie. I found myself often raising my eyebrows at the bizarreness of the book. A looming sense of unease reigns over the book."
The Trial,5,"October 14, 2022","I think part of that comes from Kafka's ability to capture the edge of reality itself. You have your knowledge of the world, built upon consumption of copious amounts of information and personal experience and it allows you discard whatever doesn't fit to this other realm of the absurd, the wrong, the unreal. However, there is something in-between, an intersection between what could be but shouldn't, it is just believable enough to be possible, but not so much to be imaginable, and that makes it creepy, or what we call Kafkaesque."
The Trial,3,"February 2, 2023","Now, the writing (and translation) is superb and the story just begs you to keep going… at first. The point of this novel (and the whole idea of Kafkaesque societies in general) is that the protagonist and do everything he’s supposed to and he will still fail due to the inherent flaws and turnarounds that are built into the system. But as the protagonist continues and continues to go to a place at a certain time and get turned around and get flirted with by every woman, just to be like “welp, that didn’t work, may as well try again next time.” It is hard, as a rational human being, to not just think “I’ll collect my things and flee this bullshit country.”"
The Trial,4,"April 21, 2024","Außerdem: Ich verstehe jetzt nach meinem ersten Kafka-read endlich, was Leute mit kafkaesque meinen."
The Trial,4,"July 13, 2017","The word 'Kafkaesque' is bandied about a lot these days. Having now read 'The Trial' (an abandoned attempt in German when I was 15 doesn't count), I can see why that association gets made. At the same time, there's a lot of things this short novel presumably doesn't seek to draw parallels. The fact that the protagonist sleeps with (or attempts it) with every woman he encounters during the course of the story. Or the oppressively evocative architecture and description that Kafka conjures to give a sense of scene. All that said, this book does also show how arbitrary (in)justice affects people, relationships and society as a whole. Even though it has a clear beginning, middle and end, the story feels fragmented. I found it most valuable, though, in the way Kafka imagines what this ""arrest"" and trial does to how someone thinks: there's little in the way of overt physical harm that goes on in this novel, but mental trauma..."
The Trial,4,"June 28, 2022",this novel is where I started getting huge hints of 'kafkaesque'.
The Trial,2,"January 13, 2023","There are works which I have felt extremely uncomfortable, but couldn't stop reading: The Stranger, Lolita, and Last Exit to Brooklyn to name a few... while, this one was an anti-pageturner in comparison. I guess I'm not ""Kafkaesque"" enough to digest this work."
The Trial,4,"March 31, 2024","My trial of this book has ended, and my sentence is 4.5⭐️. A kafkaesque rabbit hole of absurdity, irony and paradoxical truth. It was dark, melancholic but also surprisingly funny at times. The outrageous absurdity of it all makes it so entertaining and easy to follow, while at the same time making you more confused and frustrated. ""it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary."" Poor K. ""it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance."" One whole century later, this holds true."
The Trial,3,"September 12, 2024","Franz Kafka’s The Trial is a divisive read, with a writing style that can feel dry and detached. While some readers appreciate the precision and surrealism, I found it monotonous and lacking emotional depth. The novel’s disorienting atmosphere mirrors the protagonist’s helplessness, but the absence of clear direction and emotional cues left me feeling disconnected. Kafka's style intentionally evokes confusion and absurdity, but it became aimless and boring to me who was seeking more engagement. It’s a polarizing experience, depending on one's taste for Kafkaesque themes."
The Trial,4,"July 12, 2020","Desesperante, siento odio por el texto y simpatía por el escritor. No tendría sentido buscar escenarios en los que K fuera más eficiente y lograra llevar el proceso de mejor forma, porque probablemente esos escenarios no existen. Todo el libro es esa sensación de correr sin avanzar en una pesadilla, la única palabra que se me ocurre para describirlo sería ""kafkaesque"" haha. Increíble mérito que tu apellido se transforme en un adjetivo y a la vez muy triste que sea ese adjetivo."
The Trial,4,"July 6, 2023",Kafkaesque
The Trial,1,"March 29, 2024","I'm definitely not a ""Kafkaesque"" person if anything I'm ""KafkaMEH"""
The Trial,4,"July 30, 2022","In beginsel gelezen om te kijken of ik het woord Kafkaesque vaker kon droppen. Maar was eigenlijk best wel een leuk boek, alleen een beetje raar / incompleet at times."
The Trial,3,"May 16, 2025",this was worth reading just to be able to say kafkaesque and mean it. great ending but it felt like the message required this to be frustrating and a bit dull which is tough on a girl like me
The Trial,4,"June 26, 2012","These wonderful words by John Donne epitomize humanism and social collective responsibility, and they also illustrate what this novel is NOT about. The book is a perfect illustration of Kafkaesque vision – it is about alienation, hidden and haunting menace, anxiety, unknown and unknowable complexity of the world around. Where does this alienation stem around? Kafka was born in the Jewish family and was exploring Jewish culture and spiritual heritage most of his life. At the same time the place of his birth is Prague, Bohemia, and all his books and short stories were written in German. So he was a cross-cultural person, a person open to other ethnic and linguistic cultures, a person with the cosmopolitan background. Could this really be the origin of his desire to show the world as a menacing inner cosmos of a man, trapped in his own perception?"
The Trial,4,"January 30, 2021",This book is nothing if not Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"February 12, 2014","A long time back, I started this book by a writer who was said to be the Salvador Dalí of the literary world (or maybe Dalí is the Kafka of the art world, but I digress). Kafka wrote some bizarre literature. So much so, that it earned him his own adjective - Kafkaesque; a nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to, although strongly surreal. With an ethereal, ""evil"", omnipotent power floating just beyond the senses."
The Trial,4,"January 17, 2016","I'm always a bit hesitant to use the word 'kafkaesque' when talking about books, but after reading the last of his three incompleted novels 'The Process' I might have to reconsider my stance somewhat. It is not always an entertaining book, but it is a fascinating drive through a fictional legal system which represents the shortcomings of the individual when confronted with higher powers and societal misgivings."
The Trial,2,"January 21, 2016","I feel like my brain just can't wrap itself around the sort of stuff philosophers talk about. Maybe someday I'll be able to get a better grasp on what they're trying to say, but I think for now I'll stick to more appealing subjects when I pick up a book. And anyway, I think I've read enough to know what Kafkaesque means, which is already pretty satisfying to me."
The Trial,5,"December 5, 2021","K. gets sucked into a Kafkaesque world, that will slowly, irretrievably change him to be a different man."
The Trial,3,"March 2, 2022",the epitome of the term “kafkaesque.”
The Trial,2,"October 3, 2021","The Trial hangs precariously above two equidistant pedestals: Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick, and Boredom by Moravia. All high-ranking, superbly humdrum, egomaniacal pornography. Maybe there is genius in writing a book that is boring and compelling all at once, but the affectation was too lugubrious, the viscosity was too high. The best word to describe it is, of course, Kafkaesque."
The Trial,3,"April 3, 2025","I must still say that typical to Kafka's works, The Trial continues to build a world in which one (reader) has to feel alienated and abandoned by society. I often think of M.C. Escher's work when thinking of a kafkaesque world."
The Trial,4,"July 16, 2023",kafkaesque has such a pretty ring to it… but i’m slowly starting to grasp the actual meaning of it and let me tell you.. it’s rough
The Trial,4,"May 1, 2023",i’ll go wallow in the kafkaesque now 🫶🏼
The Trial,4,"November 14, 2024","I enjoyed getting lost in the labyrinth of this story, which I have since learnt is incomplete...somehow making the labyrinth more inescapable. The world is huge and claustrophobic, maze-like apartment blocks that hold government buildings and surreal, strange interactions with characters, the female ones the oddest, and Tittorelli (the Italian court painter with a chorus of children teasing him) my favourite. It was not as razor sharp to follow as Metamorphosis, but I think the dreamlike (nightmare) quality of the story means it doesn't matter if I zone out.. I guess that is to say that this is one of those books that is all about the vibe. And if your vibe is oppression, bureaucracy and unanswered questions then this is certainly the book for you! It was written around 1914 I think? Which is strange because it feels piercingly timeless. Lastly, when people say that a certain situation is 'kafkaesque', well now I finally know what they mean. Anyway, all that to say..I'm glad the story is over and I can see daylight and breathe fresh (conditioned) air."
The Trial,4,"June 29, 2025","Had eerder dit jaar de adaptatie van Orson Welles gekeken, en terwijl ik trachtte de beelden van die film opzij te zetten merkte ik hoe het Kafkaesque tot leven komt in de verschillende media. Hoe gedetailleerd Kafka zijn locaties, uitspraken, vrijwel alles, dan ook beschrijft, ze blijven onderworpen aan de verbeelding van de lezer, die zich hoogstwaarschijnlijk een vrij normale versie verbeeldt. De opzettelijke verwarring ontstaat dan eerder door aanzienlijk lange beschrijvingen van het juridisch systeem waar je helemaal de kluts kwijtraakt -- effectief, maar niet bepaald een pretje om doorheen te lezen. Welles, daarentegen (mede door zijn affectie voor expressionisme), zet allerlei extravagante en zelfs absurdistische sets voor de camera en laat zijn personages eigenaardig praten, wat de dramatische ironie toegeschreven aan Josef K., die geen idee heeft waar hij in is beland, des te meer onderstreept. Grappig genoeg werkt het Kafkaesque naar mijn mening beter op film dan in zijn boeken."
The Trial,3,"March 7, 2025","I’ve never read any Kafka, but now I understand the meaning of Kafkaesque. The whole novel was bizarre from start to finish and I never really knew what was going on. Although, I suppose that’s the point because K also had no idea what was happening."
The Trial,3,"January 5, 2023","Camus wrote that “it is the fate and perhaps the greatness of this work that it offers everything and confirms nothing”. He was sure right. Josef K’s dream-like, dare I say Kafkaesque, interactions with the law and the crime he is accused of but not told about speaks greatly to international justice systems that are stale and often passive. When no one challenges the norm and leaves the problematic unquestioned, a blind following and poor interpretation of justice plagues the nooks and crannies of our society. Having said that, The Trial is so abhorrently written. While I don’t have an issue with dialogue heavy texts, Kafka’s dialogue was rambly, disengaging and at times incoherent. It was a true struggle to finish his work, despite how much I loved Metamorphosis when I read it a couple of years ago. I never thought I’d rate something of Kafka’s so low: 2.5 stars."
The Trial,4,"February 18, 2021","Still though, no one should use the word ""Kafkaesque."" If you want to be really pedantic about it, you could say all of life is Kafkaesque. And that makes it a less meaningful word. That's assuming you're using the word 'correctly' in the first place, which is unlikely, since no one seems to agree on a single definition. However, the Kafkatrap is definitely a term that, especially nowadays, serves a very clear purpose and meaning, and is highly relevant in today's discussions of most hot button socio-political issues."
The Trial,4,"November 22, 2024","It's neat to realize that, after years of 'kafkaesque' being applied to several disparate works and therefore being drastically diluted as a descriptor, Kafka's biggest thing is just pointing out how weird it is that people live in a society. I do think there is a lot more to be said about The Trial, but the grandest notion I'm left with at the end of this short, incomplete novel is that living a life today requires you to take part in systems that are simultaneously malicious and barely holding themselves together."
The Trial,3,"July 31, 2021","(2.75?) I'm confused. I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the book or not. I hate that most chapters were unfinished. Even if The Trial is meant to be more ""philosophy"" than fiction, I would've appreciated a more coherent read. I appreciate how Kafka conveyed his notions in his typical Kafkaesque way through a very Kafkaesque character (Josef K) but I do not like that he had to bore me so much in the middle chapters. The Metamorphosis is far better than The Trial."
The Trial,5,"July 21, 2024","It’s kafkaesque, and I adore kafkaesque."

The Trial,4,"September 27, 2024",This whole situation was downright Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"May 26, 2017",I now can agreeably relate to the term Kafkaesque.
The Trial,5,"January 7, 2022","While the offices K visits are often a little run down and rickety with oppressive air, and are unlike the hyper-ventilated modernist office spaces that Murphy examines, the same complexity persists from older to newer bureaucracies that generate these truly Kafkaesque dynamics in which diseases as weird and incomprehensible as ‘sick building syndrome’ can materialize in mysterious ways. Trials such as illnesses can arrive as unexpectedly as the literal trial that materializes for K who is woken up in his bed by the news of it at the novel’s opening. And the pending uncertainty that pervades the entire book speaks to the way comprehensible causality gets lost within the complex relations of modernity, particularly in how bureaucratic decisions get made in an almost arbitrary manner. I think there are some especially insightful comments on the contingency of history that relate to Benjamin’s notion of “history as a trial in which man, as an advocate of dumb nature, brings charges against all Creation and cites the failure of the promised Messiah to appear.” There’s a moment in the fantastic cathedral scene near the end of the novel that Kafka mentions an image of Christ’s burial depicted in one part of the Cathedral:"
The Trial,1,"April 28, 2025",Too Kafkaesque for my taste! lol
The Trial,2,"May 10, 2021",Kafka being Kafka for the sake of being Kafkaesque.
The Trial,5,"May 2, 2023",I’ve never read anything like this before. This was my first kafkaesque experience and I’m hungry for more. Kafka has a writing voice that’s addictive and haunting and at times hilarious and then riveting!
The Trial,4,"April 29, 2025","Het verhaal zelf is soms echt taai maar de diepere betekenis is bizar, ik snap nu eindelijk wat wordt bedoeld met Kafkaesque 🥲"
The Trial,3,"August 10, 2023","Maybe I should have read a different version of the book. This one seems a little bit too arbitrarily connected... which seems kafkaesque, but it's still bothersome."

The Trial,3,"June 4, 2024","Dark, twisted, weird, crazy, unreal, engrossing. In one word: Kafkaesque (obviously). There is something about reading Kafka that makes one feel uneasy and like they are peering into the soul of the author. Likely because of what he wrote in his lifetime, he intended to be burned but was instead published posthumously. The Trial is a story of a man accused of a crime he did not commit and his life thereafter. Neither the protagonist nor the reader is ever told what this alleged crime is, adding to the layers of absurdity and confusion. There is a fog over Kafka’s writing that obscures the plot and true meaning and must be fleshed out with time and patience (sometimes a lot of it). Although this did not emotionally impact me as much as The Metamorphosis, this novel brought up many fascinating discussions on bureaucracy, judicial systems, reality, and human behavior. It is all smoke in mirrors and our main character consistently gets lost in his attempts to follow the maze of his supposed crime and trial. The story ends abruptly and Kafka ends in the note that we will never truly understand the absurdity and illogical nature of life. Will continue to read and love Kafka for all he stood for."
The Trial,4,"May 22, 2022","Still not entirely sure what 'Kafkaesque' means, but I think that's part of the charm?"
The Trial,5,"July 3, 2023","Je lisais le livre doucement mais sûrement, puis, j'ai été happée, les mots ont glissé sous mes yeux et pouf ! j'ai fini les 150 dernières pages en 1h15.......... Banger Kafkaesque"
The Trial,4,"March 26, 2016","The book is finished and yet incomplete, much like the trial. One may argue that that's exactly how Kafka himself would've wanted it. Is the definition of Kafkaesque (i.e.: Marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity) enough to condone  the defendant and what he is guilty of? Imagine, if you will, The Trial as being the defendant and the reader being the court magistrate. Many have had their sessions prior to mine and many will continue to hold one, but this is my session and I have veto-power."
The Trial,4,"March 9, 2025","kafka’s take on the legal system is much more enjoyable than his take on bugs. while i really enjoyed metamorphosis, this story is on another level which makes it all the more unfortunate that it was never finished. the ending is fantastic and wraps up most of the abstract and confusing images and ideas that we are bombarded with in the front half of this book. i will say that for a book that is trying to be mysterious and disorienting “kafkaesque”, it spends way too much time on expository sequences that pretty much always outstay their welcome and make the third quarter of this novel a drag. still really enjoyed this tho and will be planning a re reading of both this and metamorphosis in the future."
The Trial,4,"December 23, 2022",- What makes something “Kafkaesque”?: https://youtu.be/wkPR4Rcf4ww
The Trial,5,"September 16, 2014","Should you read this novel? Is it worth your time? I think if it were written today, Kafka would have had to self-publish it. As it was, however, it was an unpublished, unfinished work, not unlike David Foster Wallace’s The Pale King, or Michael Hastings’ The Last Magazine. It was published after Kafka died, and he had left instructions for it, and everything else he had written, to be burned. Was he kidding? What is The Trial? It seems to me to be two works in one – one a farcical slapstick comedy, the other a metaphor for the absurdity of life, as relevant today, maybe more so, as when Kafka wrote it. In the beginning I was unimpressed. My first note, written on page 15 says: *seems like a bad play – boring me.* Further on, page 42-43, I wrote: *K. is a stupid idiot—like Kafka. A stream of consciousness/imagination. A flight of fantasy w/no purpose other than for his own amusement.* Then on page 45, I wrote: *A cartoon – the Three Stooges, or Charlie Chapman.* On page 72 I scribbled: *Alice in Wonderland.* But I kept reading, by now having gotten into the rhythm of the thing, writing on page 105: *so typically Kafkaesque.* I now had a better understanding of what Wallace meant in Infinite Jest, when Hal relates his experience with the grief counselor as “Kafkaesque.” Wallace is referencing Josef K.’s experience in The Trial."
The Trial,5,"May 16, 2016","This was a thought-provoking and entertaining read. Way more so considering it was written over a hundred years ago and is actually unfinished. Of course, in this Kafkaesque dream, the incompleteness seems to somehow, and absurdly, make it whole."
The Trial,4,"September 21, 2014","Now I know why Kafkaesque is the adjective it is. Kafka has a strangely claustrophobic style of writing with gradually diminishing hopes and people who seem to be content to let their lives go to hell, inch by torturous inch. The book is almost schizophrenic in that K. is persecuted by a shadowy court and its officers and he begins to believe everybody either knows about his trial or suspects it."
The Trial,1,"August 30, 2012","This is how wiktionary describes the term ""Kafkaesque"""
The Trial,4,"June 25, 2010","The Trial is one of those books you can reference for years without having read: ""It was so Kafkaesque!"" The plot can be summed up as: You may be paranoid, but they ARE out to get you. The Trial truly is a masterpiece, with or without excised parts, alternate chapters, etc. The author's deft ability to create a completely believable world in which ""normal"" rules suddenly and inexplicably no longer apply - and everyone is in on the secret but poor, hounded Josef K. - creates a spell that propels you quickly through the book, straight to its inevitable conclusion. Scary, all-abosorbing and utterly convincing. And darkly funny - in the original German, at least. I thought that much of the inbuilt humor had gone totally missing in English translation (I read an otherwise workable, if not fine, rendition by Breon Mitchell). If possible, to be read in German. I read the book in English this past winter, after reading it in German many years ago, and the beauty of Kafka's language, its complexity, simply does not fare well in translation. While English is fit to contain the subtleties of the absurd here (I think these must translate into any language), many linguistic nuances - sort of an ineffable quality that makes this a brilliant book rather than just a book of interesting ideas - are lost."
The Trial,5,"December 1, 2016","The world famous Kafkaesque feeling now makes sense to me. Like no other Kafka creates an atmosphere of suffocation, uncertainty and weirdness. All spaces are confining, with damp air and few windows, not to mention many ('normal but weird') people."
The Trial,5,"January 16, 2017","I finally understand the meaning of the term ""Kafkaesque"" and it is even scarier than what I originally thought."
The Trial,3,"August 22, 2023",Darkly humorous and a good definition for the word “Kafkaesque”.
The Trial,5,"August 29, 2020","Kafka employs plain, deadpan prose to narrate matters that teeter between the everyday and the absurd. Alternately bewildered, nonchalant and terrified, the chief character finds no respite until the end, when he submits to a never-disclosed verdict. The effect is mesmerizing, and suffocating. Catching our breath, we stay wide awake in someone else’s bad dream. The book's seventh chapter, ‘Advocate – Manufacturer – Painter’, lays out a tortured logic of opaque, arbitrary yet inexorable power, and could stand perhaps as a definitive example of ‘the Kafkaesque’."
The Trial,4,"May 25, 2017",Kafka sukses memotret kemuraman manusia modern yg dihadapkan pada alur birokrasi pelik yg seringnya kita enggak tahu gimana dalemannya. Kafkaesque tea.
The Trial,1,"August 28, 2023",Not sure if I just read a novel or had a prolonged stroke… I guess I know what they mean by “Kafkaesque.”
The Trial,4,"August 4, 2024","I feel like everything Kafka is touching is being poisoned. It's so dark that even you stop questioning, 'What is this trial about?' after a while. Quite like what we have in our lives, we lose the starting point, end up in a rabbit hole, and barely think about why. I guess it's a bit hard for me to see the humor in Kafka, as I take the term 'Kafkaesque' with a bitter understanding."
The Trial,4,"July 5, 2021","It seems a little unfair to redact a star from a novel because the plot seemed a little too jumpy and fragmented when the book was never actually properly finished, but it feels a bit Kafkaesque so I'm doing it anyway."
The Trial,4,"June 7, 2020",Kafkaesque
The Trial,5,"May 23, 2021",This truly gives the feel of the word 'Kafkaesque' to me more than any other works of Kafka.
The Trial,4,"December 28, 2023","Sometimes, when you wake up in the morning, you kind of remember your dream but it made no sense. That is what this story is like. I now know how to describe my dreams, Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"January 25, 2024","In his essay “The I Without a Self” W.H. Auden says of Kafka, Sometimes in real life one meets a character and thinks, “this man comes straight out of Shakespeare or Dickens,” but nobody ever met a Kafka character. On the other hand, one can have experiences which one recognizes as Kafkaesque, while one would never call an experience of one’s own Dickensian or Shakespearian. During the war, I had spent a long and tiring day in the Pentagon. My errand done, I hurried down long corridors, eager to get home, and came to a turnstile with a guard standing beside it. “Where are you going?” Said the guard. “I’m trying to get out,” I replied. “You are out,” he said. For a moment I felt I was K.”"
The Trial,4,"December 29, 2014",Totally Kafkaesque!
The Trial,4,"March 31, 2024","How seriously absurd is the world Kafka has created in this book. Perhaps this is the heartbeat of Kafkaesque philosophy. When the officers told K that this trial wouldn’t affect his life too much, K goes back to his work as a respected chief clerk at a bank. But the more he interacts with his coworkers, lawyers, and many people in his town; the more people tell him that he is in very serious trouble without telling him why, what, or how. K’s mind gets sucked into a blackhole of Kafka’s legal system-a blackhole that consumes his mind and devours his very being. And since this trial is absurd and defies understanding, he makes absolutely no progress at all. He is forced to dwell on unsolvable problem that he can’t simply put down."
The Trial,5,"June 12, 2025","- Addition: When I consider the arrest through lens of illness, if K truly was innocent and really just an average man, full aware of his character, with positives and negatives, then I think I have a harder time seeing a meaning in the arrest at all. Can one really assess themselves for the fault of having a self-perceived flaw, limitation, or disease of life before, suppose, a judging tribunal of doctors who assert you can’t keep up with the rest of the healthy? I can’t really tell. If the story is meant to be perceived in such a way, in a way where man cannot abstract himself from his situation and instead forced to take on the truly dark burden of a personal defect, then as they say I guess, the novel captures an image of our world that is rather Kafkaesque and dreary."
The Trial,1,"February 15, 2016","Има един чудесен термин, ""kafkaesque"". Хубава думичка, която прекрасно описва всичките ми чувства към този човек и нещата, които е ... натворил."
The Trial,4,"December 23, 2021",Reading this novel has given me a better understanding of what kafkaesque entails and evokes. A feeling of helplessness and powerlessness in a world governed by vague and absurd powers.
The Trial,2,"June 12, 2023","Gelukkig hebben we ook ""Kafkaesque"" aan hem te danken."
The Trial,5,"June 19, 2020","One might say the great act (in theaters) of when K. climbs on the bed of the painter to see the narrow confinement vestibule in a suffocating windowless room while the wooden gaps of the room stop the girls from creeping up the hall, is nothing more than a metaphor of feeling of isolation that any systematic chain offers, the suffering and the anxiety that it provides. I do not think so. Metaphors do not work in the same world that had been seen with different eyes. It is what he lived; it is what we live in; it is the base of what must be known as the harsh reality of Kafkaesque illusionment."
The Trial,3,"September 14, 2021","So The Trial, Kafka’s typically unfinished classic (writers don’t always reach the end either), has languished on my shelf for years, awaiting the right time. Leafing through it brings to mind Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Unconsoled (1995), an overlong so-called Kafkaesque novel that pales beside its influence. Kafka’s bleak vision cuts to the core of the human condition, so his style and sensibility pervade the DNA of a great deal of literature and cinema today (and have done for almost a century)."
The Trial,4,"June 20, 2025","I totally get what people mean when they say something is “Kafkaesque.” It’s a weird, uncomfortable read in all the right ways. And while I don’t usually go for media that leans this hard into the surreal or unsettling, as Eric said, “art is supposed to make you feel something”—and this definitely did."
The Trial,4,"September 25, 2024","Kafka is an author I’ve heard quite positively about, so my first venture into his literature was filled with soaring expectations and uncertainty. Those expectations were absolutely met. Rarely do you find an author who elevates seemingly inconsequential details to thought-provoking standards. The Trial, one of his most famous works, is somewhat incomplete, remaining “fragmented” as described by present publishers. Despite this, the contents present far overshadow and make up for this fact, despite what “it could have been”. I won’t pretend to truly understand what Kafka wished to convey with this work, but I will state my personal understanding (no matter how rudimentary it might be). As I see it, the book can be explored in a surface-level way, seeing it as a commentary on unstoppable and faceless corporations exacting absolute power over the helpless individual- and the subsequent struggle of said individual. The seemingly impossible task of overcoming an “invisible trial”, is haunting enough as its own concept- as Kafka brilliantly explores it through a type of absurdism and situational incomprehensibility. He is, after all, the origin of kafkaesque- the word being self-explanatory in the context of his own work. The second way to understand The Trial, is as a parallel to morality. This book is filled with decision-making from the main character, Josef K., where his unwillingness to play by the rules, his non-restraint of negative urges (a point made by the book in one of the “fragmented”chapters, remaining one of the only examples where a personality-related detail of K. is explicitly stated), high ego, bloated self-importance, and verbally and emotionally abusive attitude, are just some examples which show his true colors. Facing a trial was meant to rehabilitate him, though this expected improvement never reached K. Overall, while Josef K. might feel innocent, the fact remains that the hellish bureaucratic trial he faced throughout the 250-page novel might have never even left the start-phase."
The Trial,4,"December 30, 2024",Great book! “Kafkaesque” is one of my favorite genres so it was great to dive into the source
The Trial,3,"May 1, 2019","I have to be honest; this was my second, albeit successful, attempt at reading the novel. The reason was that again, you have to truly know that you are stepping into a Kafkaesque vein, a surrealist and paradoxical expedition. The version that I read sported a cover with a drawing by Escher, which fit perfectly. On top of that, this is the first fiction novel I've read in a while so coming back to the genre has been difficult. More so when the way that authors would write in the early 1900's is something that you might not be used to, as well as the way the characters see a world which had not time to adjust to the traumas of The Great War. But I digress."
The Trial,3,"March 30, 2021","There is always a danger when reading really famous books that they don't live up to their reputation. You also feel like maybe it is your own shortcoming as a reader, that you didn't really 'get' the book. This book perhaps did live up to its reputation though. Kafka is where almost all magical realism starts from and whenever there is anything a little weird and possibly metaphorical, we tend to use the term, 'Kafkaesque'. This book finally made me understand why."
The Trial,4,"February 16, 2024","This was a real challenge for me. I think this is my first and my (probably) last Kafka book, and yes, it was kafkaesque. I am happy I forced myself to finish it though. I feel like I just woke up from a tiring nightmare where my mind had to run 50 km and I ended up exhausted."
The Trial,5,"September 8, 2019","I got to admit, reading Kafka is not very enjoyable. It is displeasing at times, a little drag at other times, incomprehensible and tough every now and then but such is life. You even wonder if its worth reading at couple of times, but again such is life. As you live your life irrespective of everything, because you have born are not dead yet, you read Kafka once you have started and you can't let go of it. You may or may not thoroughly enjoy reading Kafka, but he gets deeply embedded in your psyche. May be thats what Kafkaesque means. I'm not sure."
The Trial,4,"January 21, 2021","But yeah, enjoyed it. Will feel a renewed sense of confidence in calling things Kafkaesque in future, knowing that I finally have some sense of what that actually means."
The Trial,4,"November 14, 2016","Strong points: Kafka was a master of the absurd, and The Trial is the masterpiece. There is no wonder that Kafka's writing has inspired the term ""Kafkaesque"", used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work. Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical. Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction."
The Trial,5,"April 11, 2018","It's usually impossible to venture into a Kafka novel without already having preconceived ideas and theories about what the Kafkaesque entails. Rather than shading my expectant experience, the absence of these notions gave my reading a different colour altogether. I found Kafka's writing to be wryly humorous. Something I hadn't thought of associating with him. It turns out, when Kafka invited his friends to a reading of the first chapter of The Trial - they laughed!"
The Trial,5,"May 29, 2022","Iridescent would someways express your perplexed thoughts toward what you read of Kafka. You're not certain the masterpiece you are confronting is on Existentialism and angst of a solitary man and some kind of autobiography of Kafka's torments in life [as always evident in his works], a critique of bureaucracy and power, Fascism, Bentham Panoptican, Kafkaesque, or a turbulent view on religion, or all at the same time, or it's just an illusory abyss likened to an unraveling life with all the bewildering questions seeking responses that are nowhere to be found. While the protagonist is strenuously demanding, the explanations represented are nowhere to be comforting or even close to making any sense."
The Trial,5,"August 19, 2017","It is quite inane that I'm to rate this masterpiece of a novel written by one of the most influential authors of past one hundred years. Anyhow reading a novel is all about a person's discernment which in my case isn't well nurtured yet but from the relative experiences, this novel is an epitome of the term 'Kafkaesque'. It isn't the sort of work which makes sense the moment you read it but of the kind which lingers you on for time and up until you get the gears in your mind functional. This novel displays the grotesque shattering byproducts of human frailty in the form of endless chains and void created in the name of 'judicial' laws and procedures indecipherable for the common masses. It's deep, dark, perplexing, mind-boggling, pointless, revelatory all at once imbibing the absurdism(""How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning"") which surrounds us. It's a must read for everyone. I'd recommend Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis' first for an introduction to his works."
The Trial,4,"October 11, 2024","this was so good!! this was my first kafka novel, and i can already tell he's gonna be an all-time favorite. parts of this felt very dostoevsky to me (one of the highest honors i can bestow), and all the kafkaesqueity made this so claustrophobic and unnerving (positive)"
The Trial,5,"November 19, 2017","It is, of course, Kafkaesque, which is to say: a nightmare where a normal person has their life wrecked by uncaring complex and bureaucratic forces, and a chilling and timeless warning of the human oppression that can arise from unaccountable systems. But it is also a very funny book, full of comic absurdity. The comedy does not detract from the horror - if anything it enhances it: our hero ""K"" is fighting for his life in metaphorical clown shoes."
The Trial,5,"July 5, 2014","I'll spare you a breakdown of the plot (apart from what you already know osmotically by living in a world where ""Kafkaesque"" is a concept as easily understood as ""Impressionistic""), but suffice it to say, this is a story that will resonate with you differently after you've doubled the number of years you've been on the earth. My original thesis, the idea I thought Kafka was all but SCREAMING through his whole book, doesn't even seem like the most logical conclusion anymore!"
The Trial,3,"February 15, 2023","""The Trial"" is truly not easy to review. Kafka describes the complex jungle of bureaucracy in a most bizarre fashion. Due to the sheer absurdity, the novel is very funny in places, but also extremely dry given the actual subject matter. The characters are all highly distorted caricatures of reality and as a reader you can strongly empathise with the confusion and desperation of the protagonist Josef K., as you are confused and desperate yourself at times while reading. I think this is also the core of Kafka's genius, but it makes his work correspondingly difficult to access. Am I now a fan of Kafka? I think not. Did I like it? Sort of, but sort of not - but I also think that ""liked"" is just not really the right term here. Let's just say that I'm at least glad I read it, if only because I've now earned permission to call things ""Kafkaesque""."
The Trial,Not rated,"April 20, 2025","Whenever I hear someone (usually a half-sentient imbecilic right-winger sloppily comparing the law courts to democrats) utter the term kafkaesque, my eyes immediately glaze over similarly to whenever people earnestly talk about Orwell. I didn't really click with this until the chapter where K. meets Herr Block. From thereon; you slowly start to see the grand narrative/Point in play here."
The Trial,5,"February 25, 2021","I expected what the conclusion of the trial would be, however, I wasn't expecting the manner in which it was enforced, that's why I was a bit surprised. Despite the abruptness, I must say it was goddamn beautiful, in a twisted way. It couldn't have ended in a better way, in my opinion at least. I feel bad for the main character. K. just woke up one day and got his life flipped without knowing why. Very exemplar of Kafkaesque. He had a little bit of hope in the form of resistance at the end, but ultimately gave in, not too dissimilar to Gregor Samsa's story."
The Trial,4,"July 17, 2021","The plot was good, with the characters laid down pretty well.. The hidden anarchy of the system was portrayed as it should be; the Kafkaesque way. Until the ending..."
The Trial,4,"January 22, 2024","Probably the best and most disturbing Kafka novel I've read. I can't think of another author who so precisely conjures the dream logic of a nightmare. The fact the story is unfinished only adds to the terrifying experience of reading it. In general, Kafka is all mood and vibe and this story of a bank clerk defending himself against a crime he's unable to learn anything about is the apotheosis of the style that has become known as Kafkaesque. Have you ever had a nightmare where you were being endlessly pursued by some malignant force you couldn't quite understand but could feel? That's Kafka's realm and the authentic experience of this novel."
The Trial,3,"August 14, 2024","Although the ending was somewhat frustrating, I enjoyed how it underscored his utter lack of control over his fate, making his efforts throughout the book seem in vain. It was definitelyyy not a light read but remains worthwhile for its kafkaesque perspective on modern existence :)"
The Trial,2,"April 9, 2024","The prose, the parables, the malleable interpretations, it's all contradictory and makes for a really obfuscating reading experience, which I think is necessary to the novel. I recognise the skill, but I can't say I enjoyed it. I do however get to use the term ""Kafkaesque"" with the authority of the law now, so that's nice."
The Trial,4,"September 19, 2024","Having spent a good amount of time in Germany, where bureaucracy notoriously runs rampant, I found this book hilarious. The amount of BS layers you have to go through in order to achieve anything to do with the system over there is ridiculous, and they stack it up so high that it would easily warrant a comedic Kafkaesque metaphor."
The Trial,4,"March 11, 2021","The adjective 'Kafkaesque' comes through and its essence is understood only near the very end. It was a slow read. The ways the law works in say India kind of mirrors the wholesale randomness and meaninglessness that becomes attached to the legal process in this book. In short, you end up as K. says, ""like a dog""."
The Trial,3,"November 21, 2022",Having recently read Ishiguro’s The Unconsoled and said it was Kafkaesque I realised I hadn’t read any Kafka! Funnily enough The Unconsoled was more Kafkaesque than Kafka..
The Trial,3,"February 8, 2024","Pretty quickly I was like, “OK so kafkaesque means dream logic, got it,” and as an avid haver and lover of dreams, I got impatient that this was supposed to be radical when this is what my brain is like all the time lol. That being said YES obviously it is a good method for showing the powerlessness in fascism!!!! But I think it could’ve been a short story or novella, sorry."
The Trial,5,"July 12, 2025",kafkaesque....
The Trial,4,"December 21, 2015","This novel led to the birth of the word ‘Kafkaesque’. Imagine this scenario. You need to get your laptop repaired. This is a task that seems fairly straight forward. You go to the offices of the company, the person sitting there tells you to visit another office. When you go to another office, the person tells you to bring more documents. When you bring more documents, you’re told that the form has to be filled online. As you try to find the form, you realize that there is none. So you call the office for help, but your call gets forwarded to an answering machine which has ten options none of which apply to your particular situation. As the stern answering system asks you to press 1 to move forward, you’re overwhelmed by frustration and anger, and you finally give up. That’s Kafkaesque. The feeling of suffocation and helplessness this book causes is overwhelming. Kafka is tough. His cruel message of opacity of life and powerless of an individual is unambiguous and harsh. It is presented with callous detachment of a sadist. Life sucks and then you die, alone, not sure why."
The Trial,4,"May 23, 2022","So, in my world, how to make life meaningful? Add love and attention to others’ lives, feeding their existence purpose while fulfilling mine with meaning. Does that make sense? Or maybe it’s too kafkaesque? Franz probably gets me."
The Trial,4,"June 1, 2022",Recommendation: read if you want to use the term Kafkaesque without feeling like a poser
The Trial,2,"September 17, 2022","On the bright side, I finally understand what ‘Kafkaesque’ means which was the whole reason I picked up this book in the first place."
The Trial,4,"December 19, 2022",interesting tale of how guilt haunts us in our day to day lives. The commentary on bureaucracy was structured in an interesting - but appreciated - manner. definition of kafkaesque if you ask me. What is the law anyways?
The Trial,4,"January 1, 2023","First time reading Kafka and first finished book of 2023 (!), and now can use the term Kafkaesque guilt-free. Strange and open to many interpretations. Looking forward to reading more Kafka this year"
The Trial,1,"May 12, 2023","The trial is the most eccentric book I've ever laid my hands on. Its probably one of the worst books I've ever read and was extremely underwhelming. I had expectations galore from the book, and I was looking forward to be influenced by the 'genius of Kafkaesque'."
The Trial,4,"February 15, 2024","read this for the sole purpose of being able to say “Kafkaesque” in daily conversation and went out of it realizing the only situations worthy of that word are reading Kafka’s books himself - they are uniquely absurd, uncanny, and “Kafkaesque”"
The Trial,3,"March 12, 2024","Patience-testing bureaucratic absurdity with some cool settings (cathedral, court, etc), but struggled a bit with this one. Kafka’s “and then” writing style and overall confusion made it tough to read at times. Plus side though: now understand what “kafkaesque” means!"
The Trial,3,"May 18, 2025","This book is best described as strange, disorienting, and bleak. At times it felt confusing, but that seemed intentional given the focus on parodying the absurdity of the legal system and an incomprehensible bureaucracy in a kafkaesque way. Not my favorite, but definitely interesting."
The Trial,4,"June 11, 2021","I had often heard the term 'Kafkaesque' used in the context of impossibly obscure, bureaucratic situations. Having read the book now, I wonder if Kafka was ever an undertrial in India. It is as meaningless and absurd but accurate a description of some of the cases we read about in the media. A man is suddenly placed under arrest one morning for unknown charges. And spends the rest of his life trying to prove his innocence, while the system, it seems, waits for him to incriminate himself. There were passages that I could actually imagine being played out in Indian courts. Brilliant!"
The Trial,4,"January 16, 2022","bleak, horribly depressing, absurd, and steeped in the philosophical. just what you ordered when you’re familiar with the term kafkaesque."

The Trial,5,"January 17, 2021",And that's the beauty of Kafkaesque gracing us all
The Trial,2,"November 25, 2022",Definitely some subtle humor here that was lost in translation for me. I think I was too focused on the dawdling pace of the story to appreciate the Kafkaesque absurdity. Would like to try this one again after being exposed to Metamorphosis and other short stories from Kafka (which I would recommend as an introduction to the author).
The Trial,4,"August 21, 2023","Now I'm allowed to use the word ""kafkaesque"""
The Trial,3,"November 17, 2023","I would give this a 3.5 because I did enjoy reading it, but I was left with a similar Kafkaesque feeling of nihilism. This one was a bit humorous, though. A great introduction into Kafka. I pictured a film throughout reading: all the court officials should be creepy crawly bugs, and Josef K., a semi-attractive young fellow who runs himself into circles. Bob Dylan and Thom Yorke could collaborate on the score."
The Trial,4,"February 19, 2024",Sooo kafkaesque
The Trial,3,"May 16, 2024","Feeling so Kafkaesque right now. It was not going to lie, a little boring at times for me but I think that’s how Kafka would want me to think of it if that makes sense. The ending was so good but I wish more of the cathedral chapter and the chapter where Joseph says no to his advocate’s themes were pushed out explicitly because. I say this more because I couldn’t understand a lot of the meanings of things throughout the book but maybe a second read is warranted!"

The Trial,Not rated,"December 23, 2024","The first half was not the 'Kafkaesque' experience I was expecting. It felt more like a guy with poor social skills repeatedly making bad decisions. It picks up in the second half once we get more (less?) clarity on his case. Joseph K is not a terribly compelling character, but the people he interacts with are. Their casual explanations of the legal system hit a bit too hard and bring back memories of my interactions with bureaucracy and government agencies..."
The Trial,3,"March 12, 2025","If you want to understand what “Kafkaesque” means, read this book."
The Trial,2,"May 13, 2023",This read was truly Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"February 23, 2024","It’s a nightmare dream where you wade through people, try to figure out what is going on, and never do. Very Kafkaesque! (Oops, that’s the point)"
The Trial,4,"May 31, 2019","The Kafka. It's so interesting to have so much commentary and so much analysis on this hidden half-finished book. Really brings me back to how Kafkaesque is used in our contemporary discourse, and how it's really a specific mix of ambiguity, combining theology, bureaucracy, and a stilted anti-human or inhuman response to other individuals."
The Trial,4,"June 23, 2020","Not the easiest of reads but a far cry from the hardest (I'm looking at you, 'Iliad'). Exceptionally Kafkaesque, it renders the term perfectly understandable and from it I can see how we were blessed to have Kafka's unique mind change the face of literature, bringing it to new places which we may never otherwise have seen."
The Trial,4,"January 14, 2024","This was my first kafka, and there were some surprising elements. His interaction with every female character he comes into contact with was questionable, to say the least. I believe it attests to his life and his relationship with women. The book, of course, sticks to 'kafkaesque' notions: the abysmal pit of bureaucracy, corrupt totalitarian power, and the untangled web of the legal system. but I felt as if it was removed of emotional factor. Our protagonist, Joseph K, doesn't seem to express a lot of anxiety or hysteria of one on trial. He doesn't sound concerned about the personal implications of it. From the moment he woke up to the arrest, he was instantly trying to take control of the situation, rather arrogantly, and he didn't question or reflect on his integrity. I assume that wasn't the focus of the text. All things considered, it was a brilliant book, and I will surely read his other works."
The Trial,4,"May 3, 2024","The protagonist gets accosted by people who say he’s arrested, without telling him the reason. What follows is a very Kafkaesque storyline, the reasons of his arrest of course confound us and the protagonist until the very end."
The Trial,2,"July 7, 2024","Well sorry about the two stars Kafka. First of all, this book was published posthumously by a friend and is as a result increasingly disjunctive- especially with chapters even titled “Fragments” found at the end of the book that don’t really fit in. Kafka’s works are really unique and interesting (it’s no wonder we even have the term Kafkaesque), but I think that they work better as shorter stories like The Metamorphosis instead of like this. The ending is really interesting and I enjoyed it’s profundity (although I will confess much of it is over my head)."
The Trial,3,"September 24, 2022","The commentary on how the court was always present, at every turn of K.'s life was great. When you least expected it, everything leads back to either K.'s trial or the court. Some elements seemed quite random like the feuding neighbors and the painter's advice, but I'm assuming that is some of the Kafkaesque elements that give the story a stream of consciousness feel."
The Trial,Not rated,"April 8, 2023","The Trial was truly kafkaesque (I wonder why...), and it took me LITERALLY EIGHT MONTHS to finish it, but it was definititely worth it."
The Trial,3,"June 18, 2025",A downright Kafkaesque story
The Trial,2,"November 17, 2023","For a relatively short book this one was a slog. While I enjoyed the elements of the surreal bureaucracy from which Kafkaesque gets the name, overall this was a real struggle to get through. The plot is meandering with many characters who could have been fleshed out disappearing never to be seen again"
The Trial,4,"June 25, 2019",Eventually he goes into the court which is very Kafkaesque:
The Trial,5,"April 8, 2024","Can you imagine being arrested by a remote, inaccessible authority, without your crime being revealed to you? Maybe doesn't seem as farfetched as it should! There's a reason ​kafkaesque​ became a word, after all. Max stitched the chapters together from Franz’s handwritten scraps so chapters do feel occasionally ... stitched together. But it does all add up to a highly engrossing, wonderfully paced, increasingly bleak book that gave me skin-crawling anxiety. Yet there is art in the bleakness! Reflection and thundering thematic resonance across space and time. Highly recommended."
The Trial,5,"February 18, 2023","I was satisfied with the well-written “Kafkaesque” situation of Josef K for the first 93% of the book. But then I was awestruck by the quality of the penultimate chapter when he finds himself discussing with the jail chaplain about the law, the lawgiver, the law guardians, and what it all means. Kafka tortures his poor characters, but not for the fun of it. The finale was such a quality reading experience. It renews my hope in the value of my quest to read all the world classics."
The Trial,2,"April 19, 2019","“The Trial” is one of Franz Kafka’s three famously uncompleted novels which, along with his short stories, cemented his reputation as one of the foremost 20th century modernists. It describes a year in the life of a 30-year-old banker who discovers he has been accused of a crime which is never revealed to him (or the reader). His search for answers and a semblance of justice turns into a helpless negotiation with a labyrinthine bureaucracy, its web of inane functionaries, and feelings of misplaced guilt. The “trial” becomes a metaphor for the everyman’s incomprehensibility of the legal system, and by extension, human existence itself. It is suffused with a darkly mysterious, evasive quality, giving it a sense of menace and unreality which has come to be described as kafkaesque. At best, it works as an atmospheric piece—full of oppressive offices, narrow staircases, constricted, unaired rooms, and even a large, empty cathedral. But the dry formality of the prose (perhaps a result of its translation from the German) makes it a laborious read, bogged down further by unnecessarily long paragraphs cramming in entire conversations without a line break."
The Trial,4,"October 2, 2019","“Kafkaesque: Marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity, marked by surreal distortion and often a sense of impending danger, in the manner of something written by Franz Kafka.” (Wikipedia)"

The Trial,4,"December 9, 2012","After all the time spent in Prague, searching for Kafka's grave (Someone must have laid false information on the internet, because we were in the wrong cemetery) and drinking a soda water I didn't order and a bad coffee at The Worst Cafe in Europe - The Kafka Cafe, near the other Jewish cemetery - I ignored Kafka and Kundera and instead spent my time with Valerie and Her Week of Wonders - still the equal third best book written in Czech - Kafka doesn't count because he wrote in German - and sitting in the bar near the Kafka Museum while my wife (I guess she was my fiancée then) explained the rules of rugby to me (I had never seen a game) - and after the awkward conversation I had with my boss at Coles about prostitutes in Prague, I still have only read The Metamorphosis* and no other Kafka. To be honest I find it Kafkaesque. (which Chrome put a squiggly red line under) - it's all a bit like Dostoyevsky. Brilliant but a lot of work. And depressing."
The Trial,4,"July 16, 2024","I seem to like Kafka even more as I aged. Maybe also because I finally got to the age of K. Kafka, an absolutely sensitive soul (an archetype of the Cancer), can always charm me with his kafkaesque——humorously absurd, confusing, and disturbing——stories. I enjoy so much Kafka’s detailed description of K’s internal psychology. I burst into laughter a few times for K’s boyish, nerdy stubbornness. But I will just give four stars to The Trial because the latter half is unfinished and underdeveloped."
The Trial,4,"August 11, 2013","This book led to the formation of word ""Kafkaesque"" defined as the helplessness of man in the face of unknown forces that persecute him without reason. This summarises this story where the main protagonist is persecuted by the Law and is not given a reason for his arrest. The entire story shows his fight to come out of this prosecution but never ever tells what exactly is he being tried for! The most intriguing part is that he stops looking for the cause after the first day and just goes on fighting without ever knowing what excatly he is trying to prove! The entire court system of that era as well as the police is a kind of mockery, who are portrayed as a theater’ act; they were open to bribery and corruption of all sorts while conducting legal procedures that made no sense."
The Trial,5,"January 2, 2017","I know what is means, “Kafkaesque” and It’s really creepy."
The Trial,5,"October 26, 2020","Through the book Joseph K. is trying to prove his innocence for a crime he does not and will not know. The desperation and lack of answers is not a new method for Kafka, in fact I can say it is a unique habit of his to confuse the reader as much as possible. This book has really disturbing parts that made me wonder if this really how Kafka views the law system. Though being a lawyer himself he portrays the lawyer Dr. Huld as a vain man who looks down at his defendants even going as far as viewing them as his loyal dogs. Kafka views the law as unjust, scary and all-knowing. He creates an absurd ambience for the sole purpose of showing that the law is inescapable, as everywhere Joseph K. goes -even a painter's house- there is a courthouse or an investigation. Throughout the book Joseph K runs from the law but the law does not let him go, even though he committed no crime, he runs and refuses to be a defeated man. The story at the end about the man and the guard is the signature of making this novel truly kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"May 31, 2018",Enjoy your Kafkaesque experience while reading this!
The Trial,4,"November 2, 2008","""the trial"" is one of those books that makes you feel really uncomfortable the whole time you're reading it. the main character is arrested and put on trial by a shady court of dubious legitimacy, and the whole time, he has no idea what's going on or even what he's charged with. perhaps most disconcertingly, he doesn't even seem that bothered by all of this. the book is full of really freaky and terrifying dreamlike scenes where strange things happen and nothing's ever explained. characters come and go without a whit of explanation. there's even a chapter that ends with an editorial note explaining that it was never finished. gahh! i kept wavering between a 3-star and 4-star review, i think because of my own frustration with never finding out any of the reasons for joseph k.'s tribulations or the true nature of the mysterious court, but then i realized that was probably kafka's point. very clever, sir. on a somewhat unrelated note, i'm glad i've finally read some kafka so i can drop ""kafkaesque"" in conversation like all the pretentious hipsters that i love to hate."
The Trial,3,"October 2, 2016","One word to describe this book: Absurd. I mean, what the fuck just happened? Maybe I am just overwhelmed by the 'quasi-philosophical Kafkaesque allegory' about Joseph K."
The Trial,5,"July 11, 2012","If you want to understand what Kafkaesque means, this would be the book. What a bizarre paranoia the character in this book suffer. This novel is not really a story but a dreamlike description of an ordeal."
The Trial,5,"April 5, 2016","Today, the word Kafkaesque which had been engraved in my mind’s lexicon for years gained new meaning, new proportions. With a hounding justice department, an unexplained case and a rational defendant, Franz Kafka’s The Trial leaves you questioning the basic foundation of every institution that has been created by mankind till yet. The Trial unlike Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis was realistically unreal. While Gregor’s metamorphosis into a caterpillar in the latter can at best invoke in you sympathy for the unlikely, Mr. K’s journey in the former leaves you perplexed and disturbed about the present. Kafka’s caricature of Mr. K as an intelligent young man with visible charisma also aides in the construct of his theme, that nothing and no one are safe from the world. The world here becomes a riddle; you can’t solve but have to follow."
The Trial,4,"February 23, 2015","This is Kafka's most famous work, and indeed it is the text that typifies the term Kafkaesque. Filled with contradiction, hyperbole and an almost infuriating variation of writing styles - the story of Herr K., his mystery trial and his attempts to 'prove' his innocence is all at once entertaining, thought provoking and maddening."
The Trial,1,"May 16, 2021","The Trial has often been labelled as one of Kafka's best, and with the term Kafkaesque being thrown around all the time I thought I would give it a go. I now see that oppressive and nightmarish qualities that are described with the term Kafkaesque refer to the state the reader is thrown into as they read his books. I understand that this book was published posthumously so I shouldn't be too harsh but it was so terribly written that I wish I could somehow unpublish it."
The Trial,4,"November 26, 2016","Kafka. Kafkaesque. I wanted to read about existentialism and his idea of giving up to the hopelessness of the world. Absurdity-finding meaning in a meaningless world, the feeling of helplessness, submitting to the bureaucracies of the world."
The Trial,4,"January 5, 2021","Procesas parodo, kad žmogus negali likti vienas prieš realybę autentiškame santykyje. Bet koks noras ir pastangos tai daryti, galiausiai atsitrenkia į betarpiškumo fantazmą, o pati tikrovė tampa tik dar viena operuojama sąvoka bei reiškiniu. Jį supa popieriai, biurokratija, normos, procedūros, kiti žmonės, jų idėjos, lūkesčiai, norai, nuotaikos, viltys. Absurdas tampa socialine realybe, diskursu, struktūromis, žmonių ryšių lauku. Kafkiška (Kafkaesque) - tai tarpasmeniniai santykiai, savo gijomis rezgantys tinklus, tampančiais realybės pakaitalu be jokių arba iškreiptų nuorodų į ją. „Procesas“ yra pertekliaus paradas; tai potvynio banga viršyjanti jūros sienas ir išmetanti į krantą nuolaužas."
The Trial,5,"January 1, 2016",Kafkaesque doesn't even begin the scratch the surface of this bizarre trial that we're all embroiled in. Nothing left to do but wait for our executions -- and maybe learn a couple things about the court of life along the way.
The Trial,2,"September 6, 2023","I appreciate Kafka’s originality and the coined term; ‘Kafkaesque’, but by the Gods it was just so boring."
The Trial,2,"February 13, 2011","This isn't a difficult read, and it's not long, but I still don't think it's really worth the effort. Maybe in its context it was more noteworthy, but a brief description of what it means for something to be 'Kafkaesque' would provide you with as much food for thought, entertainment, enjoyment, whatever, as The Trial itself does. The characters are lifeless and/or annoying, the plot and writing uninteresting. Reading it wasn't that much of a trial, but it certainly wasn't a trip to Flamingo Land. It was a bit like ironing three shirts on a Sunday afternoon when it's raining outside: you don't really mind it, but you'd be rather making cheese on toast all the same."
The Trial,5,"November 20, 2024","Kafka's writing in The Trial is incredibly gripping. The way he describes the behavior of character's is fittingly kafkaesque to the most delicate detail - from the loud echo of K.'s footsteps on the marble floor of the cathedral to the contortions that a pleading man's face goes through while he's in the grip of the court executioner. Reading Kafka is immersive and he has the ability to completely suck you in, even without a fully established plot line."
The Trial,5,"February 15, 2015","It has it's shortcomings - the often muddled writing (which I'll attribute to the fact that the novel was left unfinished) and the weird interactions with women (which I'll attribute to Kafka's own weirdness) - but in the end it's all subservient to the themes encapsulated so often by the term ""Kafkaesque"". The pervasive pointlessness, arbitrariness and banality of the system which Joseph K. finds himself a victim of is terrifyingly prescient and frustratingly recognisable. Plus, I'm a a sucker for unrepentantly bleak endings!"
The Trial,5,"February 17, 2023","Before reading The Trial, I based my understanding of the term ‘kafkaesque’ solely on The Metamorphosis, and did not really get half the usages I heard. This book, while seemingly less culturally relevant than The Metamorphosis, much more strongly identifies the gist of Kafka’s world."
The Trial,3,"June 15, 2011","Another requirement for my Literature and Law course, though one of my favorites. One of the quintessential lessons you learn from this work is the very idea of guilt, what is it to be guilty? Having never read Kafka in the past, I had no preconceived vision of what to expect, though now, I can say that I understand many of what people use/call ""Kafkaesque"". Another book I'd recommend to read, if you have a layover on an international flight, a day at the beach, or quiet evening home."
The Trial,4,"November 27, 2014","Kafkaesque teriminin anlamını tam olarak anlamamı sağlayan kitap oldu Dava. Bir mantık bulunamayan ve nedeni dahi bilinemeyen, sonu başından belli bir dava, işlemeyen ama işliyormuş gibi duran süreçler, kim olduğu ve davalıdan ne istediği bilinmeyen ""yüksek mahkeme ve yüksek yargıçlar"", sistemin kölesi haline gelmiş bahtsız kişiler. Haberleri açıp, aslında Kafkaesque bir ülkede yaşadığımızı görmek çok zor değil. Belki de bu yüzden, Türkiye'de daha çok okunması gerektiğine inanıyorum."
The Trial,4,"November 7, 2018","Honestly, parts of this novel were almost Kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"October 10, 2015","Well, all I can write about this book is, now, I know what the word Kafkaesque really means. And I don't want to experience something like this in real life. Waiting for The Castle and America. Though one should put a Kurt Vonnegut or Dan Brown in between these to retain one's sanity or rather as a preventive measure of depression."

Thức dậy vào một buổi sáng nọ, Josef K. được thông báo rằng mình đã bị kết án bởi một thế lực bí ẩn mà chẳng biết tội danh của mình là gì. Câu hỏi được đặt ra ở đây là lời vu khống của một người nào đó theo giả định của K. có phải là lí do khiến anh lâm vào hoàn cảnh tồi tệ này?

The Trial,5,"May 29, 2021","I would be awed by Kafkaesque and how systematic racism is drawn from this style. Sadly, the ending of this novel is how I have seen the lives of those close to me play out. Whether it be a racist system, or an entirely different maze layered on top of this one deeply buried underground of base reality. I know how much I’m tempted to behave no differently than K by the end of this book. Dr Joost Meerloo coined the term menticide, which means the killing of the mind. A gradual breakdown of the psyche under the pressures of confusion, madness, and strife, so much pressure that you will ask for death just to stop the uncomfortable present and relegate your existence to the past."
The Trial,3,"April 13, 2022","The Trial is the quintessential ""Kafkaesque"" story, in which a man called Josef K is accused of a crime, but is never told what crime he committed; and is then tried in secret, in absentia, and without recourse; all the while he tries to either ignore or take action against the trial; until  he is ultimately condemned. (I will note that although I marked this as a spoiler, the preface/introduction itself already spoils the ending - it was pretty annoying actually!). It is a caricature of an inefficient, corrupt justice system, and a metaphor for inhumane government bureaucracies all over the world."
The Trial,3,"August 11, 2024","Franz Kafka’s ‘The Trial’ is a work that, while recognised as a masterpiece of existentialist literature, poses a significant challenge to read with its perplexing narrative and unsettling themes. The novel, first published posthumously in 1925, details the story of Josef K., a man who finds himself unexpectedly arrested and thrust into a bewildering and opaque legal system. The novel’s atmosphere of confusion and dread, combined with Kafka’s unique narrative style, has given rise to the term “Kafkaesque,” used to describe situations that are extremely unpleasant, frightening and confusing."
The Trial,1,"February 15, 2022","Nonetheless, despite the pointless and dull brief, Kafka does at least achieve his goal. The novel is about a man on trial for an unknown crime of which he is innocent, in a legal system with zero justice. He is arrested and released on parole, is left to navigate a web of useless people and meaningless interactions, and is finally executed. You'll finish knowing the meaning of 'Kafkaesque' (outside the casual translation of 'dreadful'). Kafka's world is not only a meaningless, relentless society but also one where the individual should (and fails to) control their own destiny. Any attempt to take control is met with further unknown. Various Kafkaesque devices are listed:"
The Trial,3,"December 11, 2024","Point #3 is the point I’m the least confident in. There’s a good chance I read the book that way to try to make sense of what was going on and attach it to something. People always refer to Kafkaesque-ness. It’s very possible that the book is just weird without any explanation/connection to anything else. Regardless, a good read I’d say for people interested in philosophy/thinking/history (to some extent because apparently it could also all be a metaphor for totalitarianism)"
The Trial,5,"January 20, 2021","I think I'm in awe of this novel. Something about it makes me believe that even though I should be slightly repelled by it, its episodic form, its incompleteness, its brutality in giving the straight facts of K.'s case. But by the end I knew I had experienced something, unique, something new, something revolutionary. To be fair, although I started it in a fervor one October morning, my progress did slow down considerably for weeks at a time, until this past weekend I read the second half of the novel with great intensity. During those weeks without diving into Kafka, I slightly pondered at the validity of this as a Great Modernist Novel: it's clunky, it's not very lyrical or flowing (at least in Muir's translation), and it has its aforementioned incompletion. But as I sped through the chapters with Huld, Leni, Titorelli, Block, the Prison Chaplain; and the descriptions of the strange legal process, the corruption of the Courts, Huld's own absurd attempt to win K. back, and that very long dissertation on the Doorkeeper parable, I realized that what made this incomplete, messy book something worth admiring was its ideas, its modernity, its foray into previously unknown genres - the absurd, the dystopian, and indeed the Kafkaesque. Of course Kafka's style is not to be ignored - however, the fluency of his sentences as I know is best appreciated in the original German, where not unlike Latin the object and verb are switched in position from our English standpoint. Even then, Kafka's prose is not meant to be cheery or helpful or beautiful: it's cold, it shows no mercy, it allows us to be shown the world his poor characters live in. When I started The Trial, I thought it would take me a while (it did, technically) because of the long chapters and long paragraphs. But despite this roadblock from easy resting points , I tunneled through with what little literary stamina I have and sped through nearly 200 pages of this book in 4 or 5 days. In this way Kafka (and in a sense Willa Muir) are great because he (and she) is able to make these intricate and ostensibly strange plots which keep the reader reeled in, while at the same time torturing them for their interest in the story with these unbroken descriptions and conversations - Kafka and Muir do not follow grammatical rules here by not allowing paragraph breaks in between different speakers, sometimes making following a conversation all the more confusing - and perhaps that's the point. Perhaps I'm looking into this too deeply, and Kafka did not intend the reading of his works to feel ""Kafkaesque"" in and of itself (although Kafka did not have the ability to know what ""Kafkaesque"" was, he invented it!) The only work of his I'd read before this of his was, of course, The Metamorphosis, and even then I read that in a couple days despite the similar lack of paragraph breaks, etc. (And ..."
The Trial,4,"February 26, 2025","This is my first time reading Kafka, but I think he nails that strange, off kilter vibe- I can see why the term kafkaesque caught on. Most of the characters surrounding Josef flitter in and out of the story, only popping up long enough to heighten his sense of anxiety and impending doom. It can be absurdly funny at times tough, such as Josef’s attempts to have a legal discussion with a painter of the court, while neighbourhood girls constantly endeavour to break into the painter’s apartment in an effort to have their portrait done."
The Trial,3,"February 20, 2021","Boy is this a slog to get through! It's short, but it's dense and layered and miserable. At least now I have a sense of what is meant by ""Kafkaesque"" . . ."
The Trial,4,"May 16, 2021","This is one of the marquee quotes from Franz Kafka’s The Trial, otherwise translated from its original title Der Prozess, which ultimately speaks to the crushing burden bureaucracy can have on the mortal soul, yet ironically while still being a creation of us mortals in the first place. With descriptive scenes that are filled with Kafka’s oppressive and dark tones - coined by the (in)famous adjective kafkaesque - this novel offers not a lengthy theme or message, but rather separate small tid-bits of messaging in different scenes (denoted as chapters) that loosely relate to each other and the protagonist’s process. In further irony for the reader, the trial itself ends up becoming a trial in the sense of a barrier that must be overcome, as Joseph K. must seek various avenues not to prove his innocence, but rather simply establish what it is he has been accused of."

The Trial,4,"May 23, 2025","Side Note: Holy fuck. I never thought that my first introduction to Kafka would leave me wanting more.

The Trial,5,"September 22, 2023","Actual acquittal is the elusive unicorn of the legal forest, rumored to prance about yet never actually seen. Apparent acquittal is akin to a mischievous imp, giving you a glimpse of freedom while snickering behind a veil of deceit. And indefinite postponement, oh, that's the eternal limbo, the treadmill of justice where one runs tirelessly but the scenery never changes, a realm where your case becomes a dusty file in the cobwebbed corners of a legal catacomb. This triad of torturous choices doesn't just shine a spotlight on the grotesque theater of bureaucratic absurdity, it tosses the reader right onto the stage, making them feel the gut-punch of the relentless, Kafkaesque merry-go-round."

The Trial,5,"July 9, 2025","The term 'kafkaesque' has come to mean a nightmarish experience of confusion, often at the hands of some sort of opaque, monolithic bureaucracy. If Kafka is indeed 'challenging' it is in his stylistic choices, in which time and space don't appear completely consistent, and many of the characters are somewhat off. Certain events seem to be impossible, but they are inserted alongside the mundane, helping create a sense of dread and paranoia in the everyday."

This book is a celebrated in literature and philosophy for a reason. But fair warning that this story feels a bit like a panic attack that won’t go away. It’s bleak, heavy, exhausting, and, well, Kafkaesque, a word that I feel I can confidently say I have a firm grasp on after reading The Trial."

The Trial,4,"February 25, 2021","Ah, Kafka's The Trial, arguably the masterpiece of one of the most enigmatic writers from the 20th century. Kafka's mysterious plot in The Trial evolves immediately from the opening lines that reveal that a certain Josef K. has been arrested without ""having done anything wrong."" From there on out, the reader is abducted into another ""Kafkaesque"" world of impossible absurdities and inextricable entanglements under nightmarish atmosphere that keeps all the characters in a state of repressed, existential alienation. The term Kafkaesque being coined to encompass the elements that are so quintessentially a part of Kafka is significant because there is probably no better way to sum up his truly original modus operandi. Kafka stands alone and reigns over his own isolated category of style and in every work of fiction he composed, we find this salient stamp of his truly unique, bizarre, and haunting imagination. Kafka conjures up a world in the Trial, as he did in his much less impressive The Castle, where faceless, inaccessible entities impose a tyrannical and omnipotent authority over society through labyrinthine bureaucracy and senselessly convoluted regulations without even the most modest appeal to reason or transparency at anyone's disposal. People in this dark world are depicted as insolent, inept, and conformist slaves consumed by pettiness and controlled like worker-bees by an amorphous, ubiquitous menace that lurks beneath the fabric of every corner and aspect of life. People are shown as frigid and wantonly unreasonable throughout the Trial, functioning as the proverbial ""cogs in the machine"", simply filling their mechanical roles without ever questioning or trying to conceive the basic foundation, aim or framework of the system at large, which is so remote to their understanding. One telling line in the trial is when the lawyer who is helping Josef in the inexplicably protracted and nebulous procedures of his case, trying with tortured effort to explain the byzantine inner-workings of the system avows that ""it's often better to be in chains than to be free."" It speaks to the existential conflict at the heart of Kafka's literature, where freedom leaves one always struggling and suffering in the gulf of paranoia and ambiguity that is never resolved with any satisfying closure. The mysterious trial of K. creates the whole backdrop of the story and mobilizes all the actions, without ever actually materializing or really taking place, at least in the formal sense of what a trial is, though this is certainly not the type of one found in reality. It's clearly a metaphor or an emblem of some deeper thread of life that concerned Kafka. There is never even the slightest hint for any real or coherent explanation of K's arrest, nor does it ever even seem necessary to the twisted logic of this world to unveil one. Really, K is not under ""arrest"" in the conventional sense of the word. He is allowed to continue through the monochromatic humdrum of his life, going through the stifling routine of his bank job, while trying for the ..."
The Trial,4,"May 31, 2020","The Trial begins as almost eccentrically as The Metamorphosis, the beginning of which is unforgettably unusual: One morning Josef K. gets arrested for an unknown reason, which is not explained to him, and he tries to find out why he has been arrested, what's behind the deep mystery of his conviction and trial. The enigmatic system that has arbitrarily arrested him is an ambiguous and powerful force with an hierarchial order, making the reader question justice and the law. The novel is very exciting and kind of eerie: the feeling of mystery and alienation that the protagonist's experiencing can be felt in almost every line. There are some eccentric characters and absurd events, like the arrest itself, which are typically Kafkaesque. One can't help but feel for Josef K., and wonder what he may have done to get arrested, of if he has been arrested for no reason; however, I must say that Josef has some moral flaws, too: he's a proud, sort of arrogant man, trying to feel superior to others even in his dire situation, and he is sort of lustful, which I think got him into trouble even more. The parts in the cathedral, with the whip-man, when Leni and the lawyer Huld were first introduced were very interesting and great. However, Chapter 7 and some parts of Chapter 8 (definitely excepting parts with the painter Titorelli, which I totally enjoyed reading) were extremely boring, but other than those, this is a highly interesting book."
The Trial,4,"June 11, 2020","More than anything I love the setting in this book. Going into this I was expecting a stereotypical Kafkaesque world full of sad office workers and beetles toiling against an unknowable bureaucracy, and while that is kind of what I got, I'd expected it to more resemble a bleak hellscape than a Wes Anderson movie. Everything is bleak, but in such a silly way. The bumbling mechanisms of the law that ruin K.'s life are awful, but you've gotta laugh. And the sheer ridiculousness of the situation just makes it even more sad and hopeless - well done Kafka! (Kinda spoiler coming up) In a similar way I just love how the setting, the law and K.'s psyche get more and more indistinguishable as the book progresses and the law begins to encroach more and more into K.'s life. I'll always be a big fan of dream-like settings in books and this is a doozy of an example. (Kinda spoiler ended)"
The Trial,3,"October 30, 2020","Have you ever been accused of something you haven't done? This novel is all about that. But Kafka also captures the tedium of bureaucracy. In fact, this novel is where the term Kafkaesque comes from, to describe unnecessarily complicated and frustrating experiences, especially with bureaucracy."
The Trial,5,"May 29, 2021","In the introduction to this book, JP Stern wrote “ ‘Kafkaesque’ Is the only word in common English use which derives from German literature. Its meanings range from ‘weird’, ‘mysterious’, ‘tortuously bureaucratic’, to ‘nightmarish’ and horrible... a process in the course of which the humdrum elements of our experience are estranged from us.”"
The Trial,4,"December 1, 2023","3. **Kafkaesque Atmosphere:** The term ""Kafkaesque"" is often used to describe situations marked by surreal complexity and disorienting bureaucracy. ""The Trial"" epitomizes this atmosphere, portraying a world where the rules are unclear, and the individual is caught in a nightmarish web."
The Trial,4,"March 9, 2025","Part of Kafka's unfinished works published posthumously, The Trial is a curious piece of literature that I'm still fleshing out my thoughts about. One thing is for sure, it is a ""Kafkaesque"" tale."
The Trial,5,"February 1, 2021","So, during the whole novel the nature of K's crime is unknown to him and also to the readers. But he was guilty of something that he had been punished for. This novel was not completed by Franz Kafka though it was published after his death. That's his way of trying to confuse people as he himself was. In his writings he doesn't represent the normal parallel world but the world through the Kafka's eyes. It's world is called Kafkaesque. He has presented his miseries and anxiety in his writings which the reader could know through his writings."
The Trial,5,"September 15, 2020","Clearly, this novel's tone and style is influential, and, so unique, only the author's name can be the appropriate adjective--- ""Kafkaesque""."
The Trial,5,"November 19, 2020","Dalam dunia sastra, ada istilah yang digunakan untuk menyebut gaya penulisan cerita yang menggambarkan situasi yang membingungkan, rumit dan tidak logis, dengan cara surealis dan terasa seperti sedang berada dalam mimpi buruk. Itu disebut Kafkaesque. Dalam novel Proses ini digambarkan dunia di mana masyarakat tidak berdaya di hadapan hukum. Hukum bukanlah alat untuk mencari keadilan, justru hukum adalah senjata untuk menindas. Orang yang berurusan dengan hukum tidak akan pernah menang atau mendapat keadilan. Suasana seperti mimpi buruk ini yang digambarkan seperti hidup dalam kekuasaan Totaliterian tidak lagi menjadi mimpi saat terjadi perang dunia ke 2. Keadaan seperti mimpi buruk ini terjadi di bawah Hitler, Stalin, dan pemimpin otoriter/totaliter lainnya."
The Trial,4,"December 26, 2023","The Trial by Franz Kafka follows a year's events in the life of Josef K that has been deteriorating into a fatal mess ever since his inexplicable arrest for an undisclosed crime he allegedly committed. The book follows the implications of the trial in his life and his futile attempts to mitigate it. The exhausting process of trial and the convoluted law bureaucratic system behind it remains as an epitome of absurdity. Although the charges under which the accusations have been made against the protagonist were never explicitly disclosed to him throughout the trial, he has no choice whatsoever on the whole matter other than to take part in the predetermined course initiated by the beginning of the trial which might only end with his death. He tries to muster as much help as he can procure that only proves to be inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. The sheer absurdity transpiring on the mere thoughts about the feasibility of winning over such an unspecified trial that might exist as long as him is already asphyxiating, not to mention that nothing makes any profound sense in regards to the trial itself as it starts proceeding. This excruciating process of trial stands as a metaphor to the endless and futile search for meaning in our meaningless existence and the absurdity of our lack of choice over our existence other than to be proceeding with such meaningless trial until the end while receiving a perplexing silence as the only answer from the vast universe. The book has such complex layers and existential metaphors in the events as well as the characters involved in it. One might even regard this as a satire of the absurd complexity involved in the then prevalent legal system and its evolution into an oppressive bureaucracy since kafka himself was a doctor of law. Whether it was a satire of law or an existential nightmare or psychological horror or all of the above-mentioned things must be left to the subjective interpretation. The ambiguous ending, surreal events, psychological and existential dread all ally to make this experience an epitome of the word Kafkaesque."
The Trial,3,"February 11, 2025","After finding myself pretentiously using the term Kafkaesque far more often than is appropriate for someone who had never read any Kafka, I thought it about time to pick up this famous, horrifying tale of inexplicable arrest and the brutality of an opaque court system."
The Trial,4,"February 26, 2018","I am involved in my own version of ""The Trial"" here in Canada. I was named in a Native land claim and although I have a Crown Patent and a registered Ontario deed to my property, I have spent the last 25 plus years defending my title. In other words, I have legal, government sanctioned title to my property yet the government is supporting the Native claim and saying I don't have legal title. Government policy is supposed to exclude third party private landowners from Native land claims. Sound like something that could be in Kafka's book? I am hoping that I am not executed, but one never knows. I was seeking legal advice from someone who is familiar with Native issues in Canada and his last statement to me was ""You have my deepest sympathies. It's Kafkaesque for you."" On that note, I decided I had to read ""The Trial."""
The Trial,3,"June 17, 2020","There's two really profound scenes: when Josef K encounters the painter, and the ending in the cathedral. In between the more philosophical moments, K does things that make absolutely no sense, sabotaging his relations with higher court officials instead of using the help that is being offered to him. This, to me, is what felt Kafkaesque - the frustrating dream-logic where simple things are overlooked, where your fate is all but sealed."
The Trial,3,"January 19, 2021","I've heard the term Kafkaesque before. ""That's Kafkaesque."" I think there was a Breaking Bad episode named that. Honestly I think most people who use it don't know what it means. I don't know what it means and I read the damn book!"
The Trial,4,"July 7, 2024",I was excited to read this as I wanted to be on the inside of what “kafkaesque” meant.
The Trial,3,"March 11, 2025","Kafka is effective at setting the atmosphere of the book, he paints a very gritty and gloomy world that makes you feel almost claustrophobic at times. When he describes the oppressive thick dusty air of the courtrooms it really sets a scene. The phrase Kafkaesque becomes very apparent while you read this book, as it often feels like you are in a bureaucratic and physical labyrinth. The Court is clearly a powerful entity in this world, yet its officers have rooms in grubby attics and its hearings take place in vast gloomy grey rooms. Kafka also takes great effort to show the absurdity of this bureaucratic system, how inefficient, confusing and corrupt it is, since we are following a protagonist who is being accused of an allegedly serious crime, but we know nothing about it. There is a feeling of helplessness and confusion from the very beginning."
The Trial,4,"May 12, 2018","Kafkaesque as a phrase always held an ambiguous meaning for me. It ranged from incomprehensible because someone deliberately and badly tries to shroud a subject in mystery - like R.P. Khan and his Principles of Communication Engineering, to a story which is plain old weird even as events themselves are straightforward, leaving the person the things are happening to bewildered, but don't deter him from going on, like American Gods, perhaps. As it turns out, ""Kafkaesque"" might just be a catch-all for all things weird. Granted my sample size is not all that large, yet. But based on The Trial, it would be hard to give an explanation of that term. Perhaps that's why that term exists? Beacuse there is no explanation that can quite convey what ""Kafkaesque"" means."
The Trial,4,"August 17, 2020","I read this book because of the persistence of the word 'Kafkaesque'. I think I did not get it at all at times and then at times, I just hated what was going on. To be in the book (reading it, thinking as K) was frustrating. To observe the greater montage of the comings and goings was to be cynical and anguished. There is much text written about the nothingness, the bureaucracy, the gear-turning pedal-pushing nature of the plot which goes in circles, and in the continuous reaction of the prior graph or chapter."
The Trial,4,"June 29, 2021","Now, on this book, it took me a long time to read because i felt confused and always searching for meaning on everything. But thankfully the internet exists and I now know what Kafkaesque means. From what i can see this book (The Trial) is a perfect example of Kafkaesque and after reading further into the meaning of this book i began to understand it and piece everything together."
The Trial,5,"January 29, 2022","Kafka has a unique style, a style so unique anything remotely resembling his writing style is called kafkaesque."
The Trial,3,"June 10, 2024",This novel has given us a resonant adjective – ‘Kafkaesque’ - to describe a faceless bureaucracy and justice system that are answerable to no-one.
The Trial,4,"October 6, 2024","This is true Kafkaesque because it is essentially K. alienation and separation from society. He is slowly but surely let go from his job by the end and all the people he seems to meet just disappear from his life and in the end well, he himself disappears from this world and dies."
The Trial,5,"December 27, 2024","Throughout the narrative, Josef K. encounters various individuals, including people from the courthouse, his colleagues, family members, and neighbours. However, everyone seems to doubt his innocence. The situation becomes even more bizarre when Josef K. occasionally finds opportunities to clear his name, only to realise that the law is nothing more than a broken system of bureaucracy, run by the most corrupt individuals in the country. These contradictions, which Josef K. finds inexplicably surreal (a term now widely referred to as ""Kafkaesque""), drag him deeper into despair and, ultimately, oblivion."
The Trial,3,"April 30, 2025","at the very least, _now_ i can try to inject the word ~kafkaesque~ into my vocabulary with ~knowing~ (but with no less pretentiousness... let's be real, i will never use this word irl unless i were trying real hard to impress someone, and even then...)"
The Trial,3,"November 29, 2018","Kafkaesque - surreal, fantastic, yet at the same time shackled to the details and processes of mundane life."
The Trial,4,"March 8, 2023","The plot itself is a prime example for a kafkaesque situation: hopeless, weird, inexplicable and literally feels like anxiety."
The Trial,2,"August 4, 2024","Jesse Pinkman would probably call this book kafkaesque. Skinny Pete and Badger would nod and agree. And I would agree. However, after the first few chapters, it became clear to me that the book lacked reasons to read it beside this."
The Trial,4,"May 16, 2018","It is unlikely that you have never heard of this book before. It's Kafka's masterpiece, the origin of the term ""Kafkaesque."" Its protagonist is trapped in a bizzarre legal process carried out by a remote and unaccountable court for a crime he is never told the nature of. In many ways there are parallels with the old East German Stasi or the secret courts which try terrorism cases in modern Britain. To call this a book about authoritarianism is, though, to miss the point. The book is essentially a black comedy and a satire which touches on aspects of religion, sexual morality and the general pointlessness of life. It's a book about alienation, first and foremost and contains many passages reminiscent of Sylvia Plath's the Bell Jar, Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of Being, all of which owe a debt to this far superior work of art. My favourite parts are the description of the first hearing, the episode with the artist, the delightful Leni and the unbelievably depressing commentary on the parable of the door keeper. It's ridiculously dark but you find yourself laughing out loud. Brilliant!"
The Trial,4,"July 17, 2020",I was in kafkaesque state while completing this book!!!
The Trial,5,"May 26, 2021","Initially, I was struck with the same impression gleaned from reading the law books for my personal statement. For an outsider, the intricacies of law with the accompanying convoluted vernacular seem wildly inaccessible. There is no alternate way to view this but as inherently unfair. The same collective ignorance is very much present in the Trial. For all hopes that today things might be different, change remains limited. Josef's faceless slander seems analogous with fake news, among other quotidian phenomena. Kafka had his finger on the pulse. At heart, the insidious bureaucracy remains and has been compounded. Inexorably so, it's easy to imagine myself (and anyone else, don't think even for a hot second you are safe) slotting right into a Kafkaesque future. In return, Kafka opts not to offer even the slightest morsel of consolation. This kind of nitty-gritty reality portrayal is a bit of a mood dampener."
The Trial,3,"June 12, 2021","It's essentially about a self-important man, a banker who prides himself on his work ethic and stature in the world, who is brought down a number of pegs by an arrest for a crime he and the reader are never informed of. He and his lawyers presumably must defend him in courts that are run by incomprehensible rules and influence on the outcome can come from anywhere. It's weird and dystopian, so not a great thing for me to be reading during the dragging on of the COVID-19 pandemic when I need all the positivity I can get. But somehow I persevered, and the thing is done. I'm glad I read it, am glad I now have a deeper understanding of the word ""kafkaesque"" (aka bleak, inane, existential angst, meaninglessness of life...all those concepts that are better steered away from to live the good life). Having said that, I also believe that living a good life involves diving deep into oneself and one's psyche and the pathos of humanity from time to time. But you must come up for air. Having finished reading the Trial, I am now coming up for air. How sweet it is!"
The Trial,5,"September 7, 2017","I might be wrong about it, but Kafkaesque is still a term that I'm trying to understand. But that right there, is what Kafkaesque means to me: slow, confusing system with a righteous front that is designed to dehumanised people, seemingly labyrinthian locations for occasions which makes no sense (confusing corridors that lead to almost everywhere, and again, court in the attic), faceless bureaucracy with confusing language and rigid followers (the judge mistook K for a painter when he's a bank clerk)."
The Trial,2,"December 21, 2022",The book was such a kafkaesque mood read. A depressing read. Mood! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The Trial,4,"April 2, 2023","This has to be the most cryptic book I’ve ever read though. Like what dafuq am I supposed to make of this? Apparently Kafka is known for writing like this tho, it’s his style. “Kafkaesque”, which is a term that refers to a nightmarish or repressive world that is often present in Kafka’s works"
The Trial,5,"April 23, 2024","The rest is filled with anxiety-driven scenes in gloomy settings. A horrific tale of nothing and perhaps that is what Kafkaesque is all about. No matter how much you try to relate with K. you would feel distant from him at every turn. You want to read what is on the next page, yet you are scared to go ahead, as the tale grows more horrific and nightmarish. The scenes grow darker and cramped. The people become more secretive than ever and it all seems to leading to nothing."
The Trial,4,"June 28, 2024","I did not enjoy reading this at all. It felt like I had a fever every time I picked up the book. My vision started spinning and I felt sick. It was all confusing, my head hurt. I listened to crime jazz to put myself in the mood for it, but that only seemed to make it worse. I think I got the full kafkaesque experience from reading this, and when I discussed it with my grandpa, who did his doctorate on something related to Kafka (I don’t know what and it’s impossible to get anything out of him in a reasonable amount of words), he was very content with my reading experience."
The Trial,4,"February 15, 2025","However, contrasting to the way the words in this book are written in a spectacular and specific delicateness, the actual story is quite boring when you pull yourself away from it and try to think over it in a sobered state of mind. This was why I actually managed to finish this book over a span of months. I found myself often forgetting about Josef K., and only being suddenly reminded by a kafkaesque moment in real life, thinking to myself “Oh, I wonder how his case is going right now.” At first, the idea of being accused by a crime one did not commit intrigues you to an unimaginable extent, but Josef K.’s venture through this is ultimately pointless and boring."
The Trial,4,"November 14, 2016","Strong points: Kafka was a master of the absurd, and The Trial is the masterpiece. There is no wonder that Kafka's writing has inspired the term ""Kafkaesque"", used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work. Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical. Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction."
The Trial,5,"May 22, 2017",This was a brilliant novel that I can't stop thinking about. I now completely understand why people use 'Kafkaesque' as an Adjective.
The Trial,5,"July 8, 2017","'Franz Kafka[a] (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work, which fuses elements of realism and the fantastic,[3] typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.[4] His best known works include ""Die Verwandlung"" (""The Metamorphosis""), Der Process (The Trial), and Das Schloss (The Castle). The term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.'"
The Trial,5,"August 21, 2019","What a masterpiece! One of my absolute favourites. There is a reason why Kafkaesque is a word in the dictionary, and this is it. The oppressive opaqueness of the protagonist's trial, his slow (then abrupt) descent into a feeling of helplessness, the bizarre yet mundane characters, everything came together for a very enthralling plot. Kafka perfectly captured (and, in a way, defined) the getting-lost-in-a-maze feeling we get when trying to navigate a bureaucratic system, where everything seems designed to infuriate, discombobulate and confuse. This is an ode to the plights of bureaucracy gone haywire, and makes for a fascinating read. Even the long passages about the workings of the court where a page-turner!"
The Trial,3,"August 26, 2020","While The Trial had an intriguing basis of the story, the execution was far from satisfying. I've noticed that with many of Kafka's works, much of the problems of these works are dismissed as ""Kafkaesque"" or ""oneiric"", as though that absolves the writer."
The Trial,4,"January 26, 2023","I love Franz Kafka. I really do. But I had to compare this beautiful literature to his other book Metamorphosis which I had given 5 stars. With that being said, I must give this book 4 stars. I just hate when the main character goes on long tangents and with K it felt like that all he was doing. That can sometimes feel like it’s suffocating the reader, but I think that’s very Kafkaesque. I mean, our main character K knows as much as we do about his trial and through the book, we can feel that suffocation, anxiety, and annoyance that he feels with the judicial system. I mean, this book speaks truth that to this day people can relate to. The judicial system is corrupt and throughout the book we go along with K trying to find anyone who can help him only to be left with the conclusion that no matter how innocent K is he will be punished for a crime he did not commit let alone knows about. Now, this book was a tough read for me. Usually, I can sit down and go through a novel of this length in one day, but I really had to take my time with this novel. But that’s not necessarily a terrible thing. I think that this novel like most of Kafka’s books spoke about things ahead of his time and that’s truly beautiful. You kind of just wish he lived to see his fame. Ultimately a 4/5 stars and read you should sit down and take your time with. -Eliana"
The Trial,5,"December 25, 2023","I can now more fully appreciate the meaning of the word ""kafkaesque"", a word now part of the dictionary and so overused that we've strayed from its true meaning. The Trial is a claustrophobic horror fiction about law and bureaucracy, filled with infuriating contradictions and circular reasoning, presented like a fever dream. The protagonist suffers from the unstoppable momentum of the legal system, whose main function is to perpetuate itself. Ultimately, the power structures we have created are just that - created. Arbitrary. But Kafka's protagonists, trapped in the web of their circumstances, never give up fighting- suggesting maybe that we can escape the systems we've created too."
The Trial,5,"September 3, 2024","This book was incredible. It is kind of like Hey Ya by Outkast (weird comparison I know but), like the song with quite meaningfully sad lyrics that serves as a party staple, the book’s content and its experience contrast dramatically (the dichotomy of it all!). The book itself is about a lonely and isolated man, who is a hard worker (he’s just like me fr), whose life gets derailed and consumed by a trial which he has no power over, no way to contribute to, and no knowledge of the bureaucracy at play (very Kafkaesque lol), but the book itself is page after page of meaningless, monotonous, confusing, contradicting information which he uncovers through his exploration of this strange and surreal court system. It should be boring, it is meant to be boring, the language isn’t especially flowery (at least not in English), the plot is convoluted and confusing and what really happens if you laid it out on a timeline? The main character is unlikable and the setting is amorphous… But it is one of the most exciting and unique books I have ever read. When I read The Castle, I thought Kafka was a bit overrated and left him alone for a while, reading this I want to read everything he ever wrote, it is shockingly relatable and relevant to my life while having nothing to do with my own experiences, how does he do this?"
The Trial,5,"October 14, 2013","I think about how often this novel has been imitated, especially in film. So much of the imagery, scenery, situations, and nightmare-like qualities has been copied and parodied to the point that it's amazing the (somewhat pejorative) term 'Kafkaesque' actually has any meaning at all."
The Trial,4,"July 30, 2017","I suppose that's just what people meant with the word 'Kafkaesque'. Only, in this book, Kafka is present without ever having the chance to perfect his lines."
The Trial,4,"May 29, 2022","This book is perfectly typical Kafka, it's internal and external dynamics carries the same sense as The Judgement, The Metamorphosis and several other of his shorter works. While not my favourite of Kafka's works (that would be The Castle), I found the beginning and the ending of this book to be very poignant and thought-provoking. It's just, while i enjoy the pieces of this book, it feels like all of its foundamental elements Kafka executed much better in other books - the family dynamic is definitely more engaging in the Metamorphosis, the elements of kafkaesque, while very fascinating and engaging its own way, I enjoyed the Castle's way of discussing them much better, and ultimately, the romantic bits of The Castle were more profound in terms of showing the best of Kafka's reflection on love, loneliness and attachments &amp; detachments. Perhaps what I am getting at is that while I loved this book, I think it wasn't edited as well as if could have been? I'm not sure. I'm glad I've eventually read this book, but I'm wondering that perhaps I should have read Kafka's bibliography in chronological order to fully enjoy this specific entry. I'm so sad that I have only Amerika: The Case of a Missing Person left to read by Kafka."
The Trial,3,"November 10, 2023","While the novel's existential themes and Kafkaesque atmosphere captivate the mind, the narrative's deliberate ambiguity may frustrate those seeking clear resolutions. The lack of a traditional conclusion leaves readers grappling with unanswered questions, which can be both intriguing and, for some, unsatisfying."
The Trial,4,"February 29, 2024","This book is definitely toned a bit more serious than I was used to (or at least expecting) yet it’s ‘Kafkaesque’ style is undeniably there. That strange philosophical feeling that Kafka often creates through his works isn’t as obvious, although - especially with its dark and unexpected ending - the book is obviously Kafka."
The Trial,4,"March 4, 2024","The story follows Josef K., who one morning wakes up to being arrested by unknown charges to him and the ones arresting him. Following chapters follows K. attempts to understand the judicial system he's been placed in, and how he can escape it. The system is flawed, and the story displays how both the workers and defendants are suffering due to it. Its typical Kafkaesque, where the bizzare situation never seem to stop. The end provides no satisfaction either, which shows the reality of such situations, that all endings are not happy."
The Trial,4,"March 6, 2024","That out of the way, this is a dark and harrowing book, and sometimes really funny, too. It fully explains why we have the word ""Kafkaesque"" in the English language: if only more modern writers had been able to do justice to the restraint that Kafka kept himself under by never revealing a fucking thing. Who are the judges? How expansive is the court? What is the metaphor - is he just commenting on the ridiculousness of German law in the early 1900's, or is he critiquing a world in which a creator presumably exists, but refuses to make itself plain and clearly understood to us, or is he commenting on society in general???"
The Trial,5,"June 7, 2025","Ascribing meaning to the meaningless, hoping through books, movies, critical thinking or conversations I will emerge the other side with a greater understanding of the universe and my position in it. Perhaps this is self-deception, an evolutionary fault, or the woes of the Dunning-Kruger. Either way i am drawn to these Kafkaesque worlds where the nihilism is strong and the optimism is between the lines i think. Life is insatiable, unforgiving and molded by the structures we build up."
The Trial,4,"July 15, 2025","Some of these are trivial. An airline lost my bag a few weeks ago and I underwent a Kafkaesque odyssey of paperwork, broken promises, luggage descriptions, and customer service waiting lines to retrieve it. Others are consequential. Insurance comes to mind. Now, ICE agents even make arrests without a warrant and without identifying themselves."
The Trial,3,"September 17, 2018","En ingles existe el termino ""Kafkaesque"", se lo puede definir cuando una persona se encuentra en un bucle infinito a la espera de un proceso burocratico. ""El Proceso"" es exactamente el ejemplo de este termino. K. es un personaje que, de la noche a la manaña, se encuentra sumergido en un proceso legal en contra suya. sin saber de que se lo acusa, lucha contra el aparato legal de su pais para lograr salir bien parado del proceso."
The Trial,3,"January 7, 2022","Three stars for the takeaways, not much for the flow of events itself as it didn't really excite me that much, but I guess that really isn't the main goal of Kafka here. Nevertheless, I could say that it indeed gave out the atmosphere of a Kafkaesque world."
The Trial,4,"June 13, 2022","1/3 of Franz Kafka's Novels, ""The Trial"" is the Kafkaesque story of Josef K., who works as a bank teller in an unknown European city, who, on his 30th birthday, gets arrested for no apparent reason. This novel, just like all of Franz Kafka's novels, was left unfinished by the time of his death in 1924. He started writing this book over 10 years before his death."
The Trial,2,"May 4, 2023","This novel never should've been published. Franz Kafka was a genius and an excellent writer, but this book was not finished, not put together, and chaotic in a poor imitation of what 'Kafkaesque' implies. Max Brod never should have gone against Kafka's wishes to provide a guess at what Kafka intended with this novel. With incomplete chapters, fragments of additions, and numerous deleted phrases it is clear that this novel was a work in progress through and through. The main message I took away was one about devoting all of one's energies to fight against a futile wrong that in turn causes a man to take away his own freedoms in a sort of act of rebellion for those very freedoms being restricted. This message is intriguing and is especially well communicated in the parable near the end of the story, but, would it shock to learn that this parable was the one aspect of this story actually published by Kafka? I think not, because this is perhaps the best part of the story. In all, the incomplete nature of the whole story leads to a confusing, trailing off of a story that really should not have been disgraced through publishing."
The Trial,4,"February 20, 2024","Enjoyed my first Kafka novel - I certainly understand the term ""Kafkaesque"" now."
The Trial,5,"September 23, 2024","Franz Kafka’s The Trial is a haunting exploration of bureaucracy, guilt, and the oppressive forces of an incomprehensible system. The novel follows Josef K., a man inexplicably arrested and prosecuted by an opaque, authoritarian legal system. As K. navigates through a labyrinth of courts, officials, and endless procedures, Kafka builds an atmosphere of anxiety and helplessness, capturing the essence of what has come to be known as “Kafkaesque.” The novel critiques the absurdity of modern institutions, reflecting the existential alienation of individuals trapped in a world devoid of reason or justice. Kafka’s use of surreal, almost dreamlike settings enhances the sense of disorientation, as K. attempts to understand his crime—a charge that remains elusive throughout the story. His futile struggle for meaning and justice parallels deeper themes of existentialism, questioning the human condition in a society where individuals have no control over their fate. The novel’s bleak ending reinforces Kafka’s worldview of existential despair, making The Trial a powerful allegory of modern life and its often arbitrary power structures."
The Trial,3,"May 28, 2025","Despite all the freaky bits, I did not really enjoy reading The Trial. The writing is tedious. I think I read a badly translated edition with archaic language. Particular oddities that distracted me are “my lord” for Mein Herr and the word “servitor.” Too many incidents also felt like filler, with the really Kafkaesque moments appearing in exposition-filled monologues. Nevertheless, the premise is gold."
The Trial,4,"December 9, 2009","I don't know anything about Kafka. I read Metamorphosis recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had developed an understanding of the word Kafkaesque over the years, presumably by contextual inference (if there is such a thing) since I hadn't read any Kafka."
The Trial,5,"August 3, 2017","As a writer myself I couldn't help but admire Kafka's craft at satire. This was an entirely different work than his shorter fiction or ""The Metamorphosis"" and didn't have that looking dark Kafkaesque feel that those works do. But, it did have the same social critique wrapped in a whole bunch of metaphor and allegory. The general way in which Kafka wrote it makes all of those open to interpretation and that is what distinguishes it from other works."
The Trial,2,"July 3, 2020","A bank executive is charged with a crime for which he will go to trial. Beyond that statement, there is nothing normal about the story starting with how his charges are served, continuing with the absence of specific charges ever stated and finally ending with punishment resulting from a trial that never happened. The story is a series of disjointed vignettes describing K's attempts to secure legal justice for himself that instead leads to strange encounters and discussions with people who may or may not know details about his predicament. The whole thing has the feel of an extended ""Twilight Zone"" episode. The author did not consider the story finished and even urged that the unfinished manuscript be burned after his death. Nevertheless, the book has earned accolades over the years in some circles and although I acknowledge that it has its unique and literary moments, I give it two stars for entertainment value. At least, I now know what is meant by something described as ""kafkaesque""."
The Trial,5,"September 29, 2021","What a distance there is between this and that Edwardian stuff I was reading just before this. Though written just seven or so years after Howards End, The Trial/Der Prozess even now challenges the reader in ways Forster just can't. It's hard to separate the degree to which an author is ""ahead of their time"" v. ""very influential"". I feel like Kafka was both. In between the time he wrote this and the time his writing became known, the world had become much more Kafkaesque on its own. But then other writers and filmmakers started using his work for inspiration."
The Trial,4,"October 18, 2021",I read this book because I didn't know what 'Kafkaesque' meant.
The Trial,5,"August 21, 2023","The term ""Kafkaesque"" derives from an absurdly nightmare-like circumstance. Franz had no idea what his case involved, was not even jailed for his alleged offence, and still had to go about his regular life while keeping this matter in the back of his mind as he went through several layers (in the court) to learn his fate. A display of totalitarianism as the court and how the person struggles to prove his innocence while slowly chipping away his motivation under absolute power. I love this book and I highly, strongly recommend this to everyone."
The Trial,4,"July 15, 2024",tldr: this book was very Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"July 21, 2024","Tutaj też zrozumiałam pojęcie Kafkaesque, które w skrócie pokazuje jak bardzo zależni jesteśmy od władzy, która w zasadzie nie jest napędzana jedna osoba a społeczeństwem, w którym żyjemy. Bo przecież „sami tworzymy rzeczywistość, w której żyjemy”."
The Trial,5,"December 7, 2024",This is Kafkaesque.
The Trial,4,"January 28, 2025","To be honest, it took me a long time to finish this book. I would have liked it more with a dramatic flare to it but it won't do justice to the 'Kafkaesque' genre."
The Trial,4,"May 10, 2025",Prior to reading this tale I wondered why Kafka's writing was singled out by his peers to garner the adjective 'Kafkaesque'.
The Trial,4,"April 20, 2018","The beginning of this novel starts with full of questions which remain unanswered till the end of the book. Then in the middle the novel goes little slow and then again at the last couple of chapters it strikes with the most bizarre incidents which again puts a lot of question in your mind. But the end is so nightmarish, it gives you a real Kafkaesque taste. Overall I liked the book, the narration except few parts in the middle."
The Trial,3,"February 25, 2019",I really liked that some characters were written in such a nonsensical way that there was a Kafkaesque logic behind them after all.
The Trial,2,"September 11, 2019","I've decided I don't really care for novels such as this. As a relatively unsophisticated reader, I don't enjoy being made to work this hard just to understand what is going on, and then failing to do so. I end up reading to get through a book rather than for pleasure. I am sure that this famous and highly regarded novel is replete with symbolism, satire and commentary on bureaucracy and the horrors of living in this surreal environment but I just didn't really get it. Perhaps I will return to it but I need to head off to read something a little less, well, Kafkaesque I guess!"
The Trial,3,"September 21, 2019",I was expecting a Kafkaesque plot and it is exactly that.
The Trial,4,"July 21, 2020","This wasn't quite what I was expecting, given all the talk around what it means to be Kafkaesque. The term has taken on a life of its own. But it was still very worthwhile... It's highly original and I don't think I've come across anything quite like it. Friends asked me if it was a mystery, and I said yes, but rather than a society or court investigating an individual, an individual is investigating a society and court. The Trial stays quite vague, and actually quite silly in a nightmarish way, until a few poignant moments towards the end which will stay with me, and are worthy of reflection."
The Trial,4,"November 3, 2024","I read this as grounding for A Cage Went in Search of a Bird: Ten Kafkaesque Stories, but it was probably the scariest book I read in October. I know there's been a massive amount of writing about how Kafka foresaw our modern world, but the first part of this book is so chilling and prescient, whether it's read as beauracracy or an authoritarian state or something else. While I was reading it, I didn't understand how it was received with amusement when it first came out, but when I separately started Metamorphosis, it was pretty funny, so maybe it was something like that."
The Trial,3,"July 6, 2025",That’s Kafkaesque.
The Trial,2,"May 3, 2019","Nonetheless it's a book I recommend people to read. You may like it, and it's always cool to say that you read a Kafka book, and you will be able to use the expression Kafkaesque (or Kafkaniano in portuguese) with a sense of propriety."
The Trial,1,"October 6, 2019","The only positive thing I have to say is that I now understand the phrase ""Kafkaesque"" means. To be more specific, I now understand the aspects of it that describe over-complicated and absurd scenarios, and I suppose that that isn't really a compliment."
The Trial,2,"April 25, 2020","I didn't hate it. I mean, I encountered just what I thought I would. There's a reason why the term ""kafkaesque"" exist but even though I knew what type of story I would find, I thought I would like it more. Also, this was unfinished so we can't really judge a story that was published posthumously without the author having the chance to edit."
The Trial,4,"October 10, 2022",The first half of this book isn't great but the second half is fantastic. Truly embodies what 'Kafkaesque' means - this hellhole of bureaucracy that leads nowhere and is useless but must be carried out all the same. The entire process of the trial is weird but it's cool how Kafka uses it to highlight parts of humanity &amp; society that are strange yet understood by us all. Towards the end you can even laugh (albeit a strange laugh that is more absurdity rather than humour) at parts because of how human the characters are in this dodgy world that's like ours but heightened.
The Trial,4,"February 4, 2023","Absurd, confusing and labyrinthine. It is very clear why the term Kafkaesque often applies to very convoluted and impenetrable bureaucratic processes."
The Trial,5,"April 12, 2023","A confusing, ludicrous, nightmarish, and yet mesmerizing display of bureaucratic convolutions and personal paranoia. This Kafkaesque (um, just Kafka I guess) journey of increasingly frustrating and arbitrary barriers is hilariously obtuse and seriously dizzying, and those who describe Kafka's work as ""the feeling of continually falling"" couldn't be more correct."
The Trial,5,"September 20, 2023","It is challenging to put to a finger on Franz Kafka's work. I mean, he is the origin of the word ""Kafkaesque"", meaning nightmarishly complex, bizarre and illogical."
The Trial,5,"September 21, 2023","Last thing is that we happen to be rewatching The Wire right now and it is a wild experience to do so while reading this book. The parallels are everywhere, and most of the characters are perfectly Kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"December 30, 2023","I love Kafkaesque allegories, so much. It was not as hard as I thought it would be, the hardest thing was the absence of a proper paragraph division, but thank God it was not as frustrating as The Castle. Kafka often described something in a bizarre fashion about something overly specific. However, funnily those sentences can be viewed from a universal perspective and they still make sense (literally, how)."
The Trial,5,"January 10, 2024","VERY PECULIAR AND STRANGE THE CHARACTERS. THE SETTINGS. And the ending was pretty absurd and incomprehensive…very much Kafkaesque. I could feel the second hand suffocation of the character and how helpless &amp; isolated he felt. Despite everyone offering him help, he couldn’t receive any. And the corrupt bureaucracy that complicates everything with a list of unnecessary trials making it harder for innocents to steer clear of guilt. And ofc it’s a kafka thing for the mc to remain calm throughout despite all the weird happenings. According to the kafka standards, i’d give this book a 10. He’s a genius tbh."
The Trial,4,"July 22, 2024","Wow the ending of this book literally made me gasp out loud, but I loved it sm. So kafkaesque, I liked how little Kafka chose to reveal about the details of the trial, K.’s charges, his innocence, (he did break into someone’s home) and even his demise is all very ambiguous and mysterious. On the surface level, this is a novel critiquing the court systems, and how you’re often perceived as guilty until proven innocent, with little assistance from the law/lawyers to help, ie: they love throwing people in prison for nothing. However, this book is somewhat existentialist too, as I found myself begging K. To leave the situation and run, considering he didn’t even know the charges brought against him. Yet, K. Felt bound by the law to stay. This would probably be around a 4.5 for me probably my fav thing by Kafka"
The Trial,5,"January 4, 2025","this is my perfect book; the intensity, the hysteria, the confusion and the surreal kafkaesque nature just enthralled me. I have thought about this book more often than I’d like to admit. I really enjoyed this fascinating discovery almost of not only Josef K. but the system and institutions that pull him under; not unlike ourselves who are also directed by massive unknown faceless conglomerates that aim to monopolise off of your confusion. however the purpose of the courts in this novel is not discovered but it is sinister nonetheless and highlights the dark underbelly of our societies and Josef K.’s reality. my favourite part was the ending, I was so shocked and it felt incomplete but also very much like a severed ending which left me with more questions than I had going into it. So much to think about and my mind is still not made up and will not be for a while."
The Trial,5,"August 10, 2017",I wrote and rewrote this review (my first in a while) and ultimately decided to take out personal anecdotes of the Kafkaesque because we all live in the modern world.
The Trial,4,"June 1, 2018","The Trial was not at all what I was expecting. I was prepared for a bit of drudgery and a depressing drag of an oppressive story. Instead, what I got was wonderfully weird, thought-provoking and even funny in places. Josef K is a high ranking bank employee who has been arrested and placed in a trial of sorts for a crime he isn't told about. His life gets turned upside down as he attempts to navigate an opaque bureaucratic nightmare world. Filled with absurdity and surrealism, this book kept me engaged and somehow the long paragraphs didn't feel overburdensome. After my book club group met, we all agreed that we didn't have any better understanding of the interpretation of the novel after discussing it for an hour, but we all enjoyed it. At the very least, I definitely understand and could competently use the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" when describing any bizarre, contradictory bureaucratic system."
The Trial,3,"July 9, 2018","It’s all a bit confused, for us as well as Josef, and certainly conveys a feeling of an oppressive government, full of secrets, and a lack of control over your life. It’s Kafkaesque if you like."
The Trial,2,"March 26, 2019","I once watched a sci-fi movie online and the reviews portrayed it as ""Kafkaesque"". I had never heard the term before. It means ""characteristic or reminiscent of the oppressive or nightmarish qualities of Franz Kafka's fictional world."" Since I liked the Kafkaesque movie, I thought perhaps I would enjoy reading one of Kafka's books. Not so much. ""The Trial"" was was written in 1914 German and later translated to English. Kafka died before completing his story so the book's ending left a lot of questions unanswered. The combination of early literature, language translation and unfinished ideas made for an unsatisfying reading experience. I feel bad leaving only 2 stars for a man whose name has become an adjective."
The Trial,4,"April 13, 2019","Damn is Kafka depressing. The slow downward spiral of frustration, not having any idea what is happening, of WHY???? it is happening, the bureaucracy, and the general depressing acceptance of it all, leads to a dark, depressing, dare I say... Kafkaesque story."
The Trial,3,"October 23, 2019",Okay so I have read the book that has given us the term Kafkaesque. It seems that Kafka only understood alienation and frustration based on his writings that I've read. I think this might have had more of an impact on me if I had read this when I was younger. I have read and seen too many stories that have probably been influenced by this book for me to have read it now and say Wow! I can see why it is as acclaimed as it was for it's time though. And there is a kind of melancholic truth in today's modern world that can be gleamed from this book. Today's world does reflect the chaos of Kafka's often in that it can sometimes be hard to understand who is really running the show and what the rules really are.
The Trial,4,"November 19, 2020","""Wtf did I just read?"" was my first reaction after reading this book. This is the first time I've read Kafka, and I now fully understand what Kafkaesque means. It felt like reading about someone's nightmare. There was always that feeling of impending doom, but you can't quite figure out why you are feeling that way. Maybe because of the ilogicalness of it all. What I got from the book, although there are many interpretations, is the futility of life. Josef K., the protagonist, needs to prove his innocence, but he doesn't even know what crime he was charged with."
The Trial,4,"February 10, 2021",reader follows the core Kafkaesque theme of the futility of bureacratic procedure and the repeative
The Trial,3,"November 9, 2022","I need to read it again and I think then I will give it a higher rating because it certainly as a book evokes a profound and very unique feeling of something similar to suffocation and a very frustrating confusion. This actually bothered me while reading, and I found the plot so tiresome, repetitive and DRY but I realize that is the point, and merely an accurate reflection of bureaucracy and the absurdity of social systems. I have come to realize what is meant by the term ""kafkaesque""that people like to throw around. It is just more of an all-consuming emotion than I anticipated. He is a genius and I need to read more, and re-read them probably, to fully absorb all that he conveys with a simple, and very strange, plot."
The Trial,4,"May 4, 2023","Kafkaesque world. After I finished it I immediately felt like I haven't absorbed the meaning or content, and probably need to read tons of reviews and maybe the book all again to peel the layers."
The Trial,3,"December 22, 2023","Not my thing, but I'd still recommend giving it a go. If anything you'll end up having a deeper understanding of what ""Kafkaesque"" really means."
The Trial,5,"August 2, 2024","I wanted to get into a Kafka book to understand what kafkaesque means, and I am thrilled that this was my first real taste of it. I have always had a fascination with the works of Wes Anderson; now that I’ve read Kafka I can see where his inspiration comes from. The atmosphere Kafka gives is funny, sad, serious, confusing, and paradoxically whimsical. This book is an amazing critique on justice and the systems we put in place to uphold it (if that is indeed what we are doing). There was a moment where I felt the same feelings I get when I have a nightmare of not being able to make it to work in time, it’s a very specific anxiety that drives the critiques this book makes even further home for the reader."
The Trial,3,"January 22, 2019","I don't feel like I am able to fully grasp the beauty of this book - possibly because it's never finished and the order of the chapters is messed up - or maybe it's because of the translation. I'm not sure. The chapters are honestly quite hard to swallow when they are so incoherent - I managed to finish it anyways, not least because I sunk the cost of buying it. But the Kafkaesque absurdity theme runs throughout the book pretty clearly. Here the absurdity is K suddenly becoming a man on trial - with the dates, locations, and even details of the trial totally unknown to him - and he later finds that the 'court' is, indeed, everywhere. In general - no idea what's going on."
The Trial,Not rated,"November 14, 2020","I read metamorphosis in high school and always remembered waking up as a bug. Kafka when was reintroduced to me when I met a girl whose last name was Franz. I learned the term Kafkaesque and went on the journey. It seems I remember his work being minimalist and having unique features like a protagonists whose name is known only as K. Knowing Kafka to have had a Jewish upbringing but one who later came under the influence of existentialism, I decided this was his reminder of Judgment Day and his bitterness at being fallen by nature--something anyone who has learned of Jewish law can relate to in how unfair it seems when you first become aware of sin and don't want to let go."
The Trial,5,"July 20, 2021","Lovely book and after reading through it I finally grasp how the adjective 'Kafkaesque' became to be. I simply love the thought process of the protagonist and wish there would have been a couple more chapters to enjoy. The unfinished chapters at the end of the book give a glimpse into what could have been. I also enjoyed it from a cultural perspective in as how everyday life of people in the early 1900s is portrayed and one can see the huge difference to ""modern"" life not only in the role of the woman but also the much more rigid hierarchical society. This book rightfully owns its place among the most famous books in the world and I wholeheartedly can recommend this read."
The Trial,4,"July 27, 2021","This book is Kafkaesque for lack of a better phrase - it undulates through disturbing and confusing scenes seamlessly, expecting the reader to either catch up, or remain dazed and confused like the characters within. There is a dream-like (or nightmarish) quality to the story elements, where seemingly random events occur with no explanation and are never brought up again. The book is good, although it can be difficult to read at some points. If not for its achievable length and position as a classic, I may well have stopped reading it earlier. Overall, a good story, but I prefer some of his other works such as The Metamorphosis"
The Trial,5,"August 4, 2021","I must admit, it took me a few weeks to write this review and I’m still not quite sure how exactly to put into words all of my impressions. “The Trial” is very… Kafkaesque. Tons of allusions, allegories, and metaphors blending into one big message that slowly blossoms right before your eyes like a rare flower. It’s simple and complicated at the same time; it’s senseless and full of hidden meanings and sub-meanings and labyrinths of descriptions flowing one into another - to me, Kafka is a genre of his own. I’ll just say this: read it, or listen to it (like I did - the narrator did a brilliant job, by the way) - I promise, you won’t regret it. It’s considered classic for a good reason."
The Trial,3,"August 30, 2023",The world creation is a lot better than the book. The idea of the kafkaesque is really something I like. But the practice of reading the book is really whatever.
The Trial,4,"August 31, 2023","At first, I didn't understand what it meant, but now it all makes sense. The Trial, a novel made from the already perplexing mind of Kafka's, make it even more perplexing to read. It comes from his own view of the world and the people around him. This book is simply on the never-ending bureaucratic processes, and of the character's own lack of dedication. This book is about bribery, and the unjust judiciary, about ignorance, and negligence. Simply ""Kafkaesque"". Intriguing, confusing and yet beautiful as it could be. I need more of Kafka."
The Trial,4,"May 25, 2024","The term Kafkaesque has become so well used over time to describe an absurd, almost contradictory, and invariably unwinnable venture or plight affecting a character, that it is quite something to experience the trope in its purest form from the man himself. This is a dense book, and once again I find myself mulling over the meanings and narrative behind it, but then that is also the delight of the story. To be both near incomprehensible and yet utterly engaging is probably the heart of what Kafka and his legacy of kafkaesque is, and if nothing else it will leave you with something to think about."
The Trial,4,"May 25, 2024","Whenever I heard the term ""Kafkaesque"" used my only point of relation was The Metamorphosis as that was the only Kafka book I had read before this, and to be honest I didn't understand it. After reading The Trial, I understand much more clearly the weight of the term. This book made me feel like I was losing my mind but in an extremely slow and methodical way, bit by bit. My favorite part of this book was the dialogue, as every character expounds upon every single thought for a comical amount of time, especially K. This book was ultimately depressing, dreary, and very German. I think I need more time to digest the implications of it in its entirety but I am glad I read it."
The Trial,3,"August 22, 2024","i’ve been wanting to read kafka for a while and after reading the trial i find that his writing is evocative of voltaire’s magnum opus candide. i very much enjoyed the dark humor and satire infused characters. the side characters that K means along the way to his final judgement were one of my favorite parts of the novel. K himself was a very compelling character and i greatly enjoyed seeing the plot play out through his eyes. i felt the plot dragged and sped up unnecessarily, but that also could have just been the nature of kafkaesque writing. i really liked the trial and will definitely be reading kafka again."
The Trial,4,"March 13, 2025","I’ve had to redefine Kafkaesque to myself an innumerable amount of times leading up to the day that I picked up this book. For the life of me, I couldn’t remember if it was intended to describe writing as nihilist or surreal or something of the sort. And while those might also be applicable to Kafka’s novels, it has taken only one (1) extremely frustrating, overly convoluted, maze of a book of his to solidify exactly what the word means forever. I can’t imagine what bureaucratic systems Franz Kafka had to deal with that might have inspired his writing, but dear god the experience of reading this is like dealing with the DMV on steroids."
The Trial,5,"April 2, 2025","This book feels like the modern working man’s accompaniment to “The Myth of Sisyphus.” It really embodies the entirety of “kafkaesque” as a descriptor, and every page matches your expectation to be subverted and confused."
The Trial,5,"August 18, 2018","The unspecified crime, the loaded accusations, the labyrinthine bureaucracy, twisted interpretations of rules and laws, being at the mercy of corrupt forces; all the classic Kafkaesque tags in chilling story form."
The Trial,3,"February 26, 2019","This entire book read like a frustratingly bizarre nightmare. I feel like to fully appreciate I'll have to do more research on the analysis and on Kafka himself, so for now I am settling for a 3 stars. It was difficult to follow at times, especially considering it's unfinished, with several story lines left completely hanging. That said, whether intentional or not, the ending, while sudden, was incredibly powerful. UGH I can't decide how I feel about this one. Atleast I can now fully appreciate the term ""kafkaesque""."
The Trial,4,"July 14, 2019","This is the second story by Kafka I've read, the first one is der Verwandlung, and this makes the term Kafkaesque so clear. From time to time I felt sick reading this book with its tangled conversation and dream like appearances."
The Trial,5,"October 28, 2019","While it's quite clear that this book is unfinished, what is there I found to be a pleasure to read. You can very much sense Dostoyevsky's influence on the novel. Like in Dostoyevsky's novels, I got a big kick out of the psychoanalytical back and forths, where each person one-ups the other with higher reasoning and better understanding. There's a good bit of dark humor here as well, and of course great criticisms of bureaucracy and the Law. Also happy to finally get a first hand understanding of the origins of ""Kafkaesque""."
The Trial,3,"March 6, 2020","So I already knew what ""kafkaesque"" meant, and I had already read ""The Metamorphosis"" when younger, but after reading this one I believe I have truly grasped the concept. From beginning to end I was consumed by a dizziness, a vertigo, an oppression that is difficult to explain, but easy to feel. The pace things happen, the way they happen, just gives you no room for comfort. And because of this, you sort of put yourself in the protagonist's shoes, for you both are immersed in a situation where you are clueless as to how it came to be. ""The Trial"" now shares the podium with ""1984"" for best endings in novels: ""Like a dog!"" is superb. On to ""The Castle"" now."
The Trial,4,"May 20, 2020","keren keren. skrng klo nonton film yg aneh kaya gini bisa bilang ""wih kafkaesque bgt filmnya"" hahahaha. ini review apaansi."
The Trial,5,"January 16, 2021","I wish we could know the conclusion Kafka would've written if he didn't abandon the project. This was my first venture into Kafka's work, and I can now say that I wholeheartedly understand the meaning of 'Kafkaesque.' The entire novel feels oppressive, as if you're suffocating (literally, for K.)"
The Trial,5,"April 1, 2021","It’s funny how sometimes you’ll read a famous literary classic and find its 100% the book you expected it to be, which is to say it 100% matches it’s cultural image. What’s fascinating is that the modern stereotypes of Kafkaesque governance (the Third Reich, the Soviet Union etc.) came about decades after the novel’s creation, yet map onto it in this very direct way, almost robbing the fictional world of its shocking power. In effect, Kafka predicted the modern world with such accuracy that his work now feels like cliche."
The Trial,4,"April 5, 2022","I read this because I wanted to truly understand where the adjective 'kafkaesque' came from. The Trial was brought up in a conversation at work, where a colleague drew a parallel between some of the corporate processes and the dystopian bureaucracy that's central to this book."
The Trial,4,"March 31, 2023","Never had read Kafka, didn't know really what Kafkaesque meant (when I researched it a bit, I found that scholars and people a lot smarter than me struggle to nail down without oversimplifying it to something like Merriam-Webster's ""nightmarishly complex, bizarre or illogical""). All that is part of what colors this book, but in some ways I think that take sort of belies what is also a pretty fascinating and prescient insight on human nature and institutions, and their intersection. Great brain food wrapped up in a compelling (and yeah, totally whacked) story."
The Trial,5,"July 14, 2023",My professor Mark Jay Mirsky said Kafka would read his stories in German to friends in Prague and they would howl with laughter. Josef K's arrest for a nameless crime presumes all are guilty. This is the impeccable paranoid logic of totalitarian regimes. My rereading will need to confirm this but I also found The Trial nightmarishly funny like a silent film pantomime. Joseph K. Is shuttled around to apparatchiks who betray themselves with every gesture. Kafka was afforded the highest honor. His name became a modifier for the inexplicable: Kafkaesque.
The Trial,5,"September 4, 2023","This was what introduced me to Kafka and the term ""Kafkaesque"" can most definitely be understood after reading this relatively quick novel. There is an unsettled mystery that carries on throughout the entire story and is never resolved which creates a sense of constant anticipation. However the whole story is a collection of mundane everyday events, which is the genius I believe since you remain interested and engaged throughout despite this. It's my favorite work of Kafka's of the three I have read, and highly recommend to anyone interested in his work. Fascinating person."
The Trial,2,"October 8, 2023","The Trial is a supposedly profound commentary on the absurdity of the human experience, specifically in relation to the ambiguous and seemingly unjust justice system. For a work that literally invented the Kafkaesque genre, I think it is quite mundane. Yes, I get that it tries to convey the frustratingly vague nature of the situation, and by extension, criticize the man-made structure of society. Yet, for such a bizarre premise, I expected more to occur... and almost nothing did. The prose itself is so dense and hard to swallow - why do yall like Kafka so much?"
The Trial,2,"April 24, 2024","Kafka created so many uninteresting auxiliary plots that I was left wary but still craving anything of substance to keep my brain from drowning in the dark, numbing doldrums. I understood about 10% of this book and the other 90% I'll just chalk up to being Kafkaesque."
The Trial,3,"May 30, 2024","But on the whole pretty decent! Kafkaesque is a perfect word because he conjures his own unique atmosphere and environment that can only ever be imitated, never replicated."
The Trial,3,"July 15, 2024",Worthwhile read if only because the meaning of the term ‘Kafkaesque’ is way clearer to me now. Perfect word to describe this story. So kafkaesque. Feverish and frustrating on purpose but occasionally pretty funny. Moral of the story is that laws are bad and that we’ve gotta get rid of lawyers. Did Kafka predicf the modern surveillance state? maybe.
The Trial,2,"November 18, 2024","I have to take a moment to laud his, quite literally insane, creativity and originality. There's a reason the term ""kafkaesque"" is part of the general lexicon. The girlies just aren't doing it like my boy Franz!"
The Trial,4,"December 16, 2024","malheureusement je l'ai moi aimé par rapport à la métamorphose qui était un coup de cœur. ce roman est une critique sur la bureaucratie en général qu'on est tous devant ces esclaves et sur le système judiciaire plus spécifiquement, où le personnage principal rencontre des situations absurdes durant son procès qu'on ne sait même pas se cause, je pense que j'ai pas tout compris sur la le concept de ""kafkaesque"", il me faudra plus de lecture de ses autres œuvres pour pouvoir mieux l'apprécié"
The Trial,4,"December 20, 2024","So interesting to read as someone who wants to go into a career in law, on the inefficiencies and corruption of the judicial system and the gap between law and truth. Very disorienting to read per usual. Got very dull in the middle but the ending completely redeemed it for me. I especially loved how the writing explored the rich inner lives of the female characters instead of just reducing them to objects of the narrators strange sexual advances. So that was sarcasm and that didn’t happen at all actually. Also I saw somebody online review this and say it was kafkaesque and I thought that was hilarious. Ya I’d sure hope so"
The Trial,3,"December 25, 2024","Certainly one of the most Kafkaesque books by Kafka, losing only to The Metamorphosis."
The Trial,3,"January 14, 2025",I read it more to educate myself on one of the pillars of modern day literature. Now I have some idea of what Kafkaesque means lol.
The Trial,4,"March 23, 2025",Overall pretty kafkaesque good job
The Trial,4,"June 7, 2025","it’s tough to read today, in my experience, when the whole world already feels Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"October 14, 2017","The Trial, at first, appears to be a plot, with lack of a more profound meaning and it goes on and on; and then I came to chapter 9. One parable in it opened up everything. A sudden understanding hit me. I think I got the whole theme, or so I believe. That is what is called ‘Kafkaesque’- it’s is a proper word in the dictionary – to describe a confusing situation (adjective)."
The Trial,4,"February 11, 2019","With this novel, I understood the meaning of Kafkaesque. This book had a profound effect on me, initally it was difficult to grasp the style of Kafka, but slowly and slowly I started expecting more vague things from book, which means I didn't demanded complete understanding of what was going on as the protagonist Josef k also is not aware what is going on, kind of trial, kind of court."
The Trial,4,"September 16, 2019","This was a bit of a mind fuck. I feel like I gained something, yet I'm not sure what. There are so many things that I didn't completely get - the random women, the crazy spaces (courthouses in attics, doors behind beds...), the system itself! But yet the feeling of being unsettled is staying with me. A friend told me to read this book as a metaphor for data privacy (instead of Orweillian, it should be Kafkaesque). Still I've yet to unpack this."
The Trial,3,"December 25, 2019","I mangel af bedre ord må den kaldes ""kafkaesque"" eller ganske bureaukratisk."
The Trial,3,"January 31, 2020","I'm sure everything has already been said about it to this point. But I'll add that the surreal/absurd nature of it is pretty interesting. That escalated quickly comes to mind here. It seems as though no one knows anything. Everyone is just trying to survive in this ever present and dangerous legal system. Something that seemingly everyone is potential fodder for. It really is quite absurd, but now I understand what is meant by Kafkaesque, or at least I think I might?"
The Trial,3,"October 20, 2020","Kafka does things in the traditional Kafkaesque way here: making them long and convoluted. The book is certainly thought-provoking and provides a statement about institutions that has stood the test of time. That being said, the convolutedness of the plot leads some sections to be somewhat dull. This is not to say the story is boring overall, but somewhat slow-moving at times, which I'm sure is intentional on Kafka's part, but still something I'm not sure how to feel about."
The Trial,Not rated,"February 18, 2021","i have no idea how to rate this book. It is very strange - Kafkaesque, of course, but I was certainly left with an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, confusion, inadequacy, anger, sadness . . . so the author succeeded in relaying his view of the alienated individual under the control of an authoritarian polity. I am planning to attend a book club meeting to discuss this book, and I look forward to that."
The Trial,5,"July 28, 2021","I was first introduced to Kafka while playing Resident Evil Revelations 2. His writings and drawing are referenced throughout the game. I became infatuated with figuring out what was so special about this author I had never heard of. Why had the phrase ""Kafkaesque"" become such a common one? This book and Metamorphosis helped me figure that out. Kafka was a genius and it's a shame this book was never finished, but even with it being uncompleted, a masterpiece is the only way to describe it."
The Trial,5,"September 27, 2021","If you’re wondering what most people mean when they call something Kafkaesque, you could do worse than reading this book or the short parable “Before the Law,” which both was previously published and is contained in a pivotal part of this novel. Both point out the absurdity of the human condition in Kafka’s unique, dreamlike style. It’s considered incomplete, but it doesn’t feel that way. It’s not pleasant, but it’s good."
The Trial,4,"October 13, 2021","A chilling glimpse into the horrors that the bureaucratic world can bring about, especially when relating to more modern day circumstances. Kafka is able to capture how the live we live is punishment enough, and by the end shows how the these systems continue to operate nonetheless, to the point where we are relieved when we are finally released from their grips. The Kafkaesque nature of this story toes the line of reality, especially when compared to the justice system and just how unjust it truly is."
The Trial,4,"November 20, 2021",This is something very unique. Probably the book that gave the term Kafkaesque. And as a fan of Kafka I suggest you to chose a good translation of this one to read cause you might end up bored with bad translations. I am not going to say any spoilers but my favourite scene is when Joseph K is at the Painter's room and two children are peeking through. It's so Kafkaesque and if you have read enough Kafka you would have probably noticed the characters like those two it's more vivid in The Castle.
The Trial,4,"January 6, 2022","(Kafkaesque) Don't bend, don't water it down, don't try to make it logical, don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly."" -Anne Rice"
The Trial,4,"October 29, 2022","I completely understand why the term ""Kafkaesque"" has been used. The novel is an enigma. Certain elements are hidden to the reader until the end. The mood is sombre and dark despite no excessive attempt to convey it. There lies the genius of the author. Nothing apparent happens and yet you are gripped by grimness. Very Kafkaesque"
The Trial,4,"May 31, 2023",The history of this manuscript and its translation is very interesting. I enjoyed the translators notes at the end. The story definitely gave me a good taste of the world as it was experienced by Kafka. And as a bonus; I have a new felt sense of the meaning of kafkaesque.
The Trial,5,"June 17, 2023","The Trial is weirdly compelling (in a way that, say, an Edith Wharton novel is not), yet not compellingly weird. Surprising, given the adjective Kafkaesque has embedded in its definition an element of the bizarre. Lined up against Magical Realism, Mythology, or even Dickens, the life of Josef K is comparably ordinary."
The Trial,3,"August 20, 2023","An abstract account of the circumstances surrounding Josef K, a truly ""Kafkaesque"" read touching upon the mundanity of modern bureaucracy. An inexplicable read, with the beginning and the end almost set in stone, to unfold the triviality of an ordinary man's effort in navigating a labyrinth of judicial hierarchies over time."
The Trial,2,"October 3, 2023",I mean I know the term kafkaesque is a thing but I didn't know why until I read this book. Ultimately a frustrating read but I also know that was the author's point. The whole book is about the futility of living which almost makes it feel like the book is not worth reading. Almost. 2 stars because I can now say kafkaesque pretentiously. Not sure if I'll read his other works but I may give The Metamorphosis a try.
The Trial,3,"December 5, 2023","it did get boring i have to admit at seeing these big court words thrown here and there, however, i guess boredom and repetitiveness was a part of conveying the kafkaesque nature of the main character’s experiences"
The Trial,2,"May 25, 2024",Glad I’ve read it so I can use “Kafkaesque” with more pretentious zeal.
The Trial,5,"January 8, 2025",“kafkaesque” has become such a prevalent word in our lexicon due to the fact that the situations joseph finds himself in and the emotions he displays while in them have only become more true in the century since this book was written. it is horrifying that not only have we not learned we have fallen deeper into the pitfalls that kafka describes in this novel and it seems we are falling more everyday.
The Trial,4,"June 29, 2025","definitely the most intellectually hard-to-grasp book i’ve read thus far in my life— however, it was so beyond worth it. following the storyline of Josef K., who is on trial for a crime unbeknownst to him, challenges what is repeatedly described as a “vengeful bureaucracy.” though written in the 1910s, the themes and concepts can still be compared to our current legal system. i hope to read more “kafkaesque” books in the future!"
The Trial,3,"February 8, 2019","My favourite part was the afterword, because there you got a bit of an explanation. Jokes aside, i really enjoyed Reading the book and now I completely understand the expression ""Kafkaesque"". Oddly enough, this state of confusion and absurdity makes me think of when I went to a football camp when I was seven years old and constantly walked around with no clue of where to be and what to do."
The Trial,2,"August 13, 2019","Motivation to read the book: just to acquire the license to say ""kafkaesque"" when possible."
The Trial,4,"July 28, 2020","I might recommend you review what 'Kafkaesque' means before venturing into this book. But as you can imagine, its superbly written and compelling, but part of me feels the ending was justified more by his reputation, than the plot of the book. I think we are missing a few chapters, and if you review the history of this book, that may certainly be the case."
The Trial,5,"August 17, 2021","Genuinely fucking amazing. One thing I don’t see mentioned is that this book is genuinely funny, I found myself laughing at the absurdity of some parts more than most. Overall I thought the book was an excellent commentary on the authoritarian nature of bureaucratic systems. Also the term kafkaesque is fun to say lol"
The Trial,2,"February 27, 2022",I can now use the word Kafkaesque in conversations and that in itself is an achievement :).
The Trial,1,"February 18, 2022","It was supremely frustrating! Is that the experience that Kafka was trying to produce through his book so we may understand the true essence of the word ""kafkaesque"" ?"
The Trial,3,"May 18, 2022",Hmmm... Kafkaesque idk what else to say tbh
The Trial,3,"July 3, 2022","Love the message and so I understand why it's delivered in a...well...Kafkaesque way. But my goodness, you have to really work for this one. The purposefully nonsensical and confusing plot does hit the mark in terms of criticising the justice system. But it goes so far that I found myself getting more irritated with the book than the justice system itself by the end!"
The Trial,5,"October 7, 2022","Definitely gave me the most Kafkaesque ""little cog on the big wheel"" feeling for the protagonist, out of the other Kafkas I read. There was some dark humor in there that made me pure Coen brothers! And I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story has en ending. Not sure why it's considered ""unfinished"""
The Trial,4,"February 11, 2023",The trial is kafka's magnum opus. The weird but beautiful writing keeps you on The edge of your seat waiting for more. The writing style at sometimes being very realistic ( for example at the time of the arrest) and times a surrealistic masterpiece. In short the trial is the masterpiece that made the whole kafkaesque philosophy come to life.
The Trial,3,"February 19, 2023",A big metaphor for how nothing is in your control and passiveness will let others make decisions for you. kind of relatable bc I feel like I'm also drifting around and seeing where my next step goes. Kafkaesque if you tell me. Kind of boring and confusing which is the point but it definitely evoked some frustrations about how mundane and torturous life is. Im not okay btw.
The Trial,5,"February 21, 2023","Kafka perfectly conveys the absurdity of our society through this piece of work. A man gets trapped in a system that he doesn't understand with rules and regulations that don't really make sense. It is a really amusing satyre of the complexity of beaurocracy. It does have some humorous elements as well. In my opinion ""the trial"" is the best example of Kafka's literary talent and really makes the reader understand the term ""kafkaesque""."
The Trial,4,"November 20, 2023","The abrupt ending heightened the sense of hopelessness and just the sheer absurdity of the unfair trial and execution, and it leaves so many questions unanswered, including who was that person behind the window observing Josef's stabbing? It is indeed nightmarish and illogical, a common theme in Kafka’s writings that have since dubbed as “Kafkaesque.”"
The Trial,4,"December 11, 2023","I want so badly to give this 5 stars as - very much in the same way «&nbsp;The Metamorphosis&nbsp;» does - it portrays so perfectly the absurd internal toil of existence as it is for me, but I think it may reflect it just a tad too well in how arduous it is to get through. I prefer my kafkaesque nightmares in shorter from I think, if only just because the real deal is already a lot."
The Trial,5,"February 10, 2024","while it's an unfinished story, with unresolved threads and in need of some serious editing, there is no denying the absolutely bleak, oppressive air this book emanates. it is as terrifying as it is prescient and smart. it's a hard book to classify, but there's no mistaking its impact. the term ""kafkaesque"" wasn't coined just for kicks n giggles - there is nothing quite like his work."
The Trial,4,"March 3, 2024","This book defines ""Kafkaesque"" and delves into the protagonist's, K., ordeal of facing an unknown accusation. Throughout, K. feels helpless amidst a confusing system where it's unclear if anyone wants to aid or hinder him. The Law is portrayed as a mysterious, complex force, with K. feeling constantly observed yet ultimately alone in his struggle."
The Trial,3,"July 13, 2024","Whoa there is so many themes weaving through this book that I was often let thinking WTF IS HAPPENING. Definitely not an easy read, but one I think it worth revisiting with more attention to detail. The story lacks comprehensive plot and is an interesting existential allegory. I’d say that it was very ahead of its time. I did enjoy how understated the surrealism is, is that kafkaesque?"
The Trial,Not rated,"July 24, 2024","I found it impossible to not describe everything as ""kafkaesque"" after reading this book. I actually remember asking my dad what that term meant after coming across it in a ""Calvin and Hobbes"" comic as a kid. Now I know that it's an apt description of working with building departments on a property in California."
The Trial,4,"August 28, 2024","This was weird, interesting, compelling, moody, did I mention weird? (One might even say… kafkaesque 😊) I admire his ability to set this strange mood, while writing very clear sentences."
The Trial,4,"October 13, 2024","While I think Metamorphosis and other stories give you a kafkaesque feel, the trial has a narrative that's Kafkaesque. I am quite confused and I think the main character is as well. But I did like it and kept wondering how the story would turn out, which led to me constantly thinking of the book during the day and wanting to continue reading. That of itself means it deserves four stars."
The Trial,4,"October 24, 2024","An intense novel, that Kafka grappled with for many years. The novel encapsulates that which is Kafkaesque; a situation that arises suddenly with nightmarish qualities. While the storyline drags and parts get redundant, there is allegorical brilliance which culminates strongly. A must-read of the existentialist classics."
The Trial,3,"November 29, 2024",This novel is an excellent example of where the term Kafkaesque comes from. This is a fever dream examination of justice and the intersectionality it plays in our lives. Do NOT attempt reading this book without learning about Kafka’s background!!
The Trial,4,"January 22, 2025",sooo kafkaesque 🫣
The Trial,4,"February 12, 2025","kafka is a genius. this is a hard read — a tiny bit because of the writing style, but more because it illuminates a bleakness in our systems. leaves u feeling like, damn. this shit is forever. this shit is corrupt. there is no way out. but anyway…i thought it was wonderful. gonna start incorporating “kafkaesque” into my daily vernacular"
The Trial,4,"March 29, 2025","Super interesting, dark, confusing, intriguing. Very Kafkaesque (bad joke). Looking up reviews and explanations, and I took the book to be a lot less about bureaucracy and more about the trials we put ourselves on. But that’s the beauty of an intensely vague metaphor I guess haha, take it however the heck you want."
The Trial,3,"July 7, 2025",The Trail is a winding kafkaesque allegory of the emasculating effect of beaurocracy.
The Trial,4,"July 15, 2025","Oppressive, nauseating, suffocating, disorienting, and for lack of a better word, Kafkaesque. It serves as a critique of the overcomplication and inaccessibility of the judicial system in Western Society due to its overbearing bureaucratic nature. A legal matter depicted as a nightmarish fever dream."
The Trial,4,"March 4, 2017",I read this book to understand what is meant by kafkaesque. I'm not sure if I got it but what I read was eerily real. Joseph K has been charged with a crime. He's not sure what the crime is but he knows he's innocent.
The Trial,5,"December 10, 2018","Kafka is much more complex than being just ""Kafkaesque"". His books, disturbing as they are, contain infinite pleasures. He is a master of description, and of reveling in the absurdity at the heart of existence."
The Trial,5,"September 24, 2019",My first read of Kafka - I understand “Kafkaesque”
The Trial,3,"February 1, 2021","I felt it meandered a bit more than I liked within some of the chapters but same sharp, Kafkaesque themes found here as well that spans a 1 year journey/descent of Joseph K's trial."
The Trial,3,"May 30, 2021",bab akhir kekalahan karakter utama kepada birokrasi (kafkaesque)
The Trial,5,"June 19, 2021","'Kafkaesque' is a well-known word, but it was fascinating to immerse myself fully in this world, which is so much more complex and ambiguous than the term alone suggests. I hadn't expected the whimsical Lewis Carroll-like quality either - albeit of a truly nightmarish kind. Extraordinary."
The Trial,4,"June 22, 2021","Re-reading this after 15 years and I have to say, is there a kind of decadent charm in all this hopelessness of the Kafkaesque universe or is it just me? Four-star review because it was an unfinished novel and at times gets a bit difficult to follow properly."
The Trial,3,"September 23, 2021","Beyond that, the writing is fairly dull in the first quarter of the book, but picks up later, with K. becoming much more engaged in the antagonistic force, &amp; in the latter half of the book, we are closely engaged with learning about the system itself. Unfortunately, nothing is resolved, but we are given a good grasp of how the court system functions, which in itself could be said to have been the main clause of the book. Overall an engaging read, fairly kafkaesque in its representation of bureaucracy &amp; the courts, manifesting the sense of the Oldest House (Control) or a Lovecraftian Horror, whose existence is beyond understanding or rationale."
The Trial,4,"September 13, 2021","One of those ""been meaning to read it for thirty years"" books. Glad I did. I really did enjoy it. Except now I'll be sensitive to the abuse of the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" by journalists using it incorrectly."
The Trial,3,"November 12, 2021","L'univers Kafkaesque, je l'approuve et l'aime. Mais il ne maîtrise malheureusement pas son art."
The Trial,3,"July 10, 2022",Feeling Kafkaesque 😫🧍🏼‍♀️🫡
The Trial,5,"July 16, 2022","Haven't really read an analysis yet, but it's an excellent commentary of thr unapproachable nature of the law. It was my first Kafka book and I'm starting to understand the meaning of ""kafkaesque"" a little better."
The Trial,3,"November 27, 2022","Bra! Fortfarande konstig och a obvi kafkaesque. Den hade bättre driv än Slottet, men det vet jag inte nödvändigtvis var en bra sak? Var lättare läst men en del av grejen ska också vara att man är liksom ”fast” i boken med huvudkaraktären tycker jag!"
The Trial,4,"December 9, 2022","That was a surprising ending, despite the absence of logic throughout, which would seem to be the point of the entire story. Yikes, allegorical books are tough to read, and yet, once you get the massiveness of this one, it seems obvious. Definitely explains the adjective Kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"May 5, 2023","Most importantly, ‘kafkaesque’ is my new favorite word."
The Trial,2,"July 5, 2023","I can respect Kafka’s ideas and obviously him having a term Kafkaesque named after him proves that he’s a way better writer than I’m picking up on but this was SO BORING. It was purposeful, I get, but so not enjoyable."
The Trial,4,"July 6, 2023","It was great, definitely one of Kafka's best works. Great characters, asides, author's comments and plot development. A bit too much detail on the law system of the time, but contributes to the atmosphere of the Kafkaesque style."
The Trial,5,"October 11, 2023","it’s my favourite of the whole kafkaesque genre. I really enjoy „the trial“ because of the absurdity of interactions and the scope for interpretation in relation to the trap, in which K. found himself caught in, while he does everything to stay in that exact same trap."
The Trial,5,"November 19, 2023","As Jesse Eisenberg says in The Squid and The Whale: “Kafka is very kafkaesque.” His love interest answers: “He would be, wouldn’t he, since he is Kafka.” Well,The Trial is very kafkaesque. In the best sense of the world."
The Trial,4,"January 23, 2024",This is my second Kafka book and I get the meaning of that feeling ‘Kafkaesque’. Story told in a completely different way. Metaphorically may mean many things. Scary and yet surprised over the way it ends.
The Trial,3,"May 9, 2024","Audiobooked as an intellectual exercise. Its not very entertaining, but I needed to understand why “kafkaesque” entered the English lexicon. Its like a long and excruciating anxiety dream that never ends, even when it ends. Read at your own peril and demise."
The Trial,4,"June 27, 2024","The word “Kafkaesque” is often used but poorly defined. Read this book, and you will well understand the term. Imagine being arrested, and placed on trial, and neither you nor your attorneys know what the charges are. This is a black story that redefines terror. It is hard to read, but a must-read."
The Trial,1,"August 10, 2024",I found it SO boring that I can't even recall why I was drawn to it in the first place... perhaps so I could feel more qualified to use the word 'Kafkaesque' in conversation?
The Trial,4,"August 15, 2024",Woah!!!! What did I just read damn the word “Kafkaesque ” really means something the book is so absurd that you will start questioning yourself what’s happening in this world and once you finish you will be left like what just happend it’s a truly masterpiece by Kafka
The Trial,4,"August 28, 2024","I'm a very rational person, so I really feel with our protagonist when he's trying to figure out what on earth is going on. However you can't really, the court works it's own way and there's nothing you can do - one might sight say kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"December 10, 2024","In my opinion this book sums the art of kafka the best, a deep dive into what people define as ""kafkaesque"" this book does it the best , it's a great read, recommend for people looking to get into kafka."
The Trial,5,"January 15, 2025",Det er noe så forfriskende med å gå inn i en bok uten å skjønne noe og å forlate den med å skjønne enda mindre - men samtidig få veldig mye ut av den. (Legger til at fornøyd med at jeg nå kan ta i bruk kafkaesque i mitt daglige vokabular)
The Trial,4,"February 26, 2025",Something about this whole story is quite Kafkaesque…
The Trial,3,"May 28, 2025","Could've been shorter lol, but I think its mapping onto religiosity and the absurdity of the human condition is worth noting. Also finally got to read the book that spurred the word ""kafkaesque,"" which is sprinkled in conversation to sound more intellectual, so there's that. Thumbs up and cool"
The Trial,3,"July 7, 2025","Classic kafkaesque. Joseph K. wokes up to a trial around its neck. Why was he found guilty, who lodged the case, we never know. All that matters is he needs to face every consequences. A bit difficult read. His train of thoughts come all at once: punctuations don't help."
The Trial,5,"February 7, 2017","If you've ever wondered why Kafka gets his own adjective (""Kafkaesque""), read The Trial. You won't be disappointed."
The Trial,4,"July 31, 2018",Will dig into other kafkaesque novels soon enough.
The Trial,4,"March 18, 2019",Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"April 19, 2019","I've been familiar with the term ""Kafkaesque"" for a long time and knew what it meant, but this was my first foray into the man's work. Disorienting and gripping all the way through."
The Trial,5,"April 20, 2019","No one does Kafkaesque better than Kafka himself, which may sound like a truism but I think is worth stating, considering how many authors list Kafka as an influence."
The Trial,4,"July 11, 2019","Very inspirational, absolutely kafkaesque"
The Trial,4,"December 24, 2019","This novel embodies the idea of Kafkaesque. You have the roving bureaucracy that governs everything based on rules, and completely devoid of right and wrong."
The Trial,3,"April 26, 2020",Weird but engaging. I can see why it's popular and spawned the adjective Kafkaesque. I did find it strange that Kay never asked what he was accused of.
The Trial,4,"July 1, 2020","Where the word Kafkaesque comes from, the absurdist dark comedy of a man who trys to fight a legal system where the rules are completely unknown."

The Trial,4,"January 12, 2024","feels like one long dream, the kind where events cascade into each other and strangers drag you through shadowy corridors and metaphors. i realized you can call so many modern postindustrial systems ‘kafkaesque’ because of how convoluted they make their processes now to confuse and distract you. applying for disability, appealing for a debt, getting a psychiatric assessment, all the clerical work and subtle charisma checks… K responded as he only could, it’s not fair to say he failed due to laziness or depravity. those that criticize him are inadvertently siding with the system haha."

The Trial,5,"February 21, 2024",This book was really Kafkaesque
The Trial,5,"March 7, 2024","This book wears you down. Long, drawn out passages about convoluted legal systems that seem impossible to understand or beat. The seemingly random placement of relevant characters and settings and dusty, dark, murky overtone of every location. K's inability, it feels, to do anything right. It's not the most pleasant book to read - but the court isn't supposed to be pleasant. It portrays this convoluted system perfectly. This is the definition of ""kafkaesque""."

The Trial,5,"June 18, 2025",I had a mental breakdown trying to read it the first time. SO GLAD I gave it another chance you truly cannot grasp the concept of kafkaesque without this read.
The Trial,4,"March 1, 2021","Kafka doesn't play around (except that's all he does- play around with what should be normal life by turning it on its head). This book was bewildering, haunting, and stunningly relevant to our society today. With a plot revolving around the trial for a nonexistent crime, Kafka's version of justice seems to draw closer and closer to reality even as the plot becomes more and more 'Kafkaesque' and absurd. The ending smacked me in the face and left me numb for a few days. That being said, this is, so far, my favorite Kafka novel and I would highly recommend it."

The Trial,4,"July 17, 2024",What was he even on trial for lol. kinda kafkaesque
The Trial,5,"April 2, 2025","Franz Kafka’s The Trial is the epitome of the term kafkaesque - to be mired in a relentless, oppressive bog of bureaucracy, sinking deeper into the absurdity of an indifferent system that offers no escape. It is a novel that thrives on its own intentional obscurity, unraveling the legal labyrinth layer by layer as Josef K. stumbles from one administrative deadlock to another. Accused of an unspecified crime, he flounders through a trial whose nature remains elusive, endlessly jumping through legal hoops only to find himself ensnared in even more of them."

The Trial,4,"February 17, 2020","-This will be 5 stars when I reread this. I know it. You know how I know it? Because halfway through it, ""The Trial"" was a 2 star book. It was a 2 star book, on reputation alone, because I hated the act of reading it. I spent weeks reading this tiny book. Weeks reading the first half of this tiny book, and a day reading the 2nd half when it clicked into place and started to make sense for me. So I will read analysis online. I will see what the luminaries have to say, and eventually I will revisit, through more informed eyes, wizened by life experience and bitter enough to really take in this Kafkaesque work by Kafka."
The Trial,5,"November 13, 2016","Right until the end of Kafka’s The Trial, I’d have ranked it around my 2nd or 3rd favourite work of his. That is, until the scene in the cathedral came along and threw the thoughts I had formed about the rest of the novel entirely off course. I have to admit that that scene also likely helped crystallise my final understanding of The Trial - insofar as I or anyone can ever come to a full understanding of it. There are a plethora of themes, motives and allusions weaved into every interaction and every seemingly unimportant detail. As always with Kafka, however, everything has its place and nothing he wrote ever has too much or too little fat. It warrants — if you’ll excuse the bad pun — and definitely deservers the type of careful reading that few books demand and actually merit to such an extent. Ultimately, it will most likely become the standard recommendation from me to those who want to start reading Kafka. It is for me the quintessential work of his, replete with all typical kafkaesque features."
The Trial,5,"December 24, 2022","What is really unique in this novel is its atmosphere. You can't really determine if what you are reading belongs to reality, dream or a universe between these two. The term Kafkaesque atmosphere is not accidental at all and you can't quite understand the phrase unless you read Kafka's works. The surreal element is prevailing but there is also a touch of humor and horror."
The Trial,3,"July 8, 2022","This story was very difficult to read and I finished, 3 or 4 pages at a time, so that I can claim to know the meaning of ""Kafkaesque"". I think I do."
The Trial,5,"January 25, 2024","I wasn’t going to write a review for this book—or any other books that I finished in the past for that matter—but I have to give it credit for sending me into a depression so dark that I was borderline suicidal for the weeks that followed. At first I read it literally, like it was just about a bureaucracy too intricately woven to be changed, especially from within. And I still believe it is—at least on the surface. But to me it has another meaning. I think it has a different meaning for everyone who reads it. I can’t really get into how I interpret it, because it’s beyond words. What I think of it is largely based on an incommunicable feeling that I started to have at the halfway point (I’ll call it Kafkaesque, as they say in literary places), right at the point when K finds out from his lawyer how complex the legal system is. If you imagine the bureaucracy he is up against as the natural process of the universe, you may also experience this. The nail was driven in when he consulted with the painter and found out his situation was utterly hopeless, that there was no way he could successfully escape this legal system. I thought of that as my life, not against a legal system, but my life in a modern society as a human. Dinasauria, We—the poem Bukowski wrote—came to mind as well. Born into a society as complicated and rigid as the legal system in The Trial, we try to fight, but only tumble in our tracks. I felt so much like Josef K, defenseless against my existence. Absolutely defenseless. Also absolutely confused about everything. Unable to understand what used to be simple about my existence. Needless to say I started dreading everything happening in my life. That’s not something I want to experience again. Hesse and my friend Leonard Cohen have successfully nursed me back to health. Anyways, I love you Kafka; you’re one of the few authors who has been able to wreck me like that; only Camus has done this kind of shit to me before you."
The Trial,4,"August 20, 2024",Loved it. I now understand what people mean when they describe something as Kafkaesque.
The Trial,5,"May 24, 2023","A novel of such ambiguity will inevitably lend itself to a diversity of interpretation, but in The Trial you can at least be sure to find every element of storytelling now defined as Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"August 27, 2016","The character Josef K. appears an indecipherable plot which attempts to disentangle from beginning to end of history, diving in a labyrinth, in delirium, in an attempt to escape to nowhere. Josef K breathes the air of painful hardships in poorly ventilated rooms. The Kafkaesque prose ensures the permanence of mystery, inconsistency, unbelievable."
The Trial,5,"January 12, 2025","The characters populating this Kafkaesque world are like shadows in a puppet theater: the bedridden lawyer who promises but never delivers, the guard's wife who seduces without freeing, the invisible judges who condemn without judging. Each encounter seems to promise an exit but only adds another layer to the incomprehensible."
The Trial,1,"January 1, 2023",Sooooooo Kafkaesque.
The Trial,4,"March 9, 2017",I liked it. I don't know how much. It was Kafkaesque. Seems to me like Kafka and Orwell would get along. Kinda sad he burned like 90% of his writings. I want to read his other books. I want to read this book again.
The Trial,5,"September 5, 2011","... that I'm a little more receptive to The Trial than i was when I first read it as an angsty 20-year-old. But the language here shimmers and the story is, at least at the outset, hilarious. (I'm sure I didn't find it funny back then!) As it moves from farce to tragedy, Mitchell's Trial layers Kafka's satire with unsettling, comic, and aggravating incident. As much as we want to condemn the oppressive legal machine and sympathize with the victimized individual, if we're honest we find ourselves laughing at, even despising, the hapless Joseph K., whom we see through before the end of the first chapter as a sort of sophisticated naif, arrogant, superior, constrained rather than enfranchised by bourgeois entitlement. And, moreover, by the second chapter, something I probably didn't even think of when I was 20, we see him as a sexual predator as well. (K.'s pursuit of Fraulein Burstner is a part of the novel I wouldn't have minded Mitchell extending a bit, since there was an unfinished chapter to draw from, added as part of the ""bonus tracks,"" about Fraulein B's efforts to shield herself from K.'s advances by taking in a feisty roommate who has strong words with K. His dalliance with the Lawyer's housemaid Leni also, like so much of the novel and alas Kafka's work, seems unresolved.) I wanted to reread The Trial as a detective fiction, for Joseph K. is the investigator of his own legal case, but of course K. is an inept detective, impatient and not very insightful, either asking the wrong questions or not asking the obvious ones: for instance he never does ask, and we never know, what crime he's being tried for. (Maybe he knows; his narrative point of view ensures that we don't learn everything.) Kafka's depiction of K. as an object of ridicule and even disdain suggests not a defense of the State and its judicial power or a demonstration of the futility of individual agency but rather a third target: the general society or, more particularly, us readers. This is a sort of parody of the ""Law &amp; Order"" crime story, and ""the people"" who yearn only to sustain their faith in the legal system. (""Faith"" being a deliberate word choice in talking about Kafka's vision, which takes K. penultimately to the Cathedral, where the last subject he interviews is the Priest, also of course a functionary of the Court, after which K. pretty much gives up fighting his case.) Citizens must believe in the sanctity of the Law, in their ""day in court,"" the righteousness of their testimony, their right to justice or revenge or the restoration of the social order, the status quo. And our willingness to believe that the accused criminal, some accused individual, is guilty, and that the courts, however shadowy, specious, baroque, are in the right, or to think that ""the truth""--that objective of sleuths and lawyers everywhere--will be arrived at, seems the most ""Kafkaesque"" aspect of this dark novel."
The Trial,4,"August 18, 2019",This is very bizarre. It sort of reminded me of Alice in Wonderland.. it is the same kind of bizarre. Very dreamlike. I'd say Kafka probably had many problems which made his writing more bizarre.. and he possibly dreamt a lot (whenever he COULD sleep -- I heard he was an insomniac). And I can tell where the word 'Kafkaesque' comes from.. though I kind of had an idea before.
The Trial,3,"March 1, 2017","Let's just say it didn't take many chapters before I understood the word ""kafkaesque""."
The Trial,4,"May 11, 2022","To be honest the idea of The Trial itself is interesting. Some bureaucracy has appointed you guilty and has decided to withold you from all information and control every step of your trial and lead you through the most convoluted path to any knowledge of the truth. The prologue up to the second visit of the court room and the visit to the court offices were all very interesting but it felt like that same cycle would continue till the end and I, already knowing the meaning of the word Kafkaesque, knew what to expect and not wanting to be dragged along in the same way as my dear Josef K., thought it right to skip to the end and see him get killed. I didn’t know what to feel about this but it just made me think no other meaning could be derived from this story. I mean what else could have happened to him. Perhaps he could have joined them, maybe he could have put a stop to them, run away. But the story wasn’t really about him. It was about everyone in the system, we were just viewing it through his eyes. Everyone is trapped in something they don’t want to do by this unnecessarily convoluted weirdly structured bureaucracy and Kafka is just trying to make us see how we are all trapped. I’m sorry this hasn’t been insightful enough (I did skip 2/3 of the book and don’t know much about the philosophy of Franz Kafka), but I’ll probably be coming back to edit this when I feel I can appreciate The Trial in more capacity without getting bored."
The Trial,5,"August 11, 2015","I read it in English translation, I lack the German to read it in its original form, a pity as Kafka was a great admirer of Flaubert and his demands for the purity of language. This was my second reading of the book and also my second attempt at a review…the first copy of the book I bought had a kafkaesque surprise in that it contained the first half of “The Trial” twice…but no second half."
The Trial,2,"September 21, 2015","So it is a conceptual novel making a point about futility and bureaucracy and the law and powerlessness and the feeling of all of society being against you for reasons unknown. Which, from what I've read about the guy, was basically Kafka's own personal outlook on life, replete with frequent existential crises. So it's certainly valuable in the sense that it succeeds in making those points. However, it's not something you plan to read again, unless you're the sort of person who is exceedingly hipster and likes to describe trying to find a good cafe in the suburbs for your morning soy latte as Kafkaesque. (hey, I'm not judging, I too favour the soy latte as my coffee of choice)"
The Trial,4,"November 7, 2015","This is the story of Josef K., a banker who is arrested for an unspecified crime and put on trial under undisclosed procedures before an unknown court. Apparently the court is large and complex and ancient, but K. is kept in the dark about all that – it’s not even certain that anyone else that he meets knows. There’s no courtroom drama. The trial goes on for a year with no known deadlines or procedures, with the action (assuming that there is any action) taking place behind the scenes. The story is absurd – pointless, nonsensical, irrational. There’s a reason we use the word Kafkaesque, right? But it was still interesting. I kept reading because I wanted to see if it was ever going to make sense. Would anyone’s actions or words prove to be consequential? Reading this book, you get the sense that nothing anybody does is going to make a bit of difference to the final verdict – the lawyer, the court painter, the clerk, even the judges. But at the same time, one of them might do something, maybe even unknowingly, that will change everything. Different people suggest to K. that he must do certain things, and that the things that others recommend are completely useless. His lawyer tells him a whole lot of nothing – pages and pages of pompous nothing. He has no way of knowing who knows the truth. K. is like a fish on a hook – he can wriggle all he wants, or hold still, but whether he gets thrown back depends entirely on the person holding the fishing rod. And it’s never clear who holds the rod; my guess is that the rod is held by everybody and nobody at once – a mass of nameless, faceless bureaucrats who don’t understand the consequences of their actions and inaction on others’ lives. And then, finally, mercifully, it ends."
The Trial,5,"October 25, 2011","The Kafkaesque trials of Josef K. provide an indelible story that has implications beyond its time. As the reader, I was pulled through K.’s struggles of navigating the bureaucratic system of the law - and he doesn’t even know the crime he’s committed. Along the way Kafka never lets a chapter (well, they aren’t quite chapters, more divisions of plot since Kafka never formally published this work) pass without a purely Kafkaesque moment. It’s the bizarre room of his hearing with its uncomfortably low ceiling, the murky air and the men cheering one moment and deadpanning him the next; it’s the law offices in which K. can hardly breath, no less remain conscious; it’s the whipper in the closet-of-a-room at K.’s offices; it’s the man who emerges from the dark corner of a room after K. had been conversing for some time; and it’s the priest who, from the secondary, crouched altar, spotlights K. in a vacant cathedral. Each one makes my heart shrink, my skin tighten, and my mind gasp. But they also provide an odd satisfaction. I wanted to see more of these moments thrown at K. to see what would unfold and what meaning Kafka could be working toward."
The Trial,4,"August 28, 2014","Do we call this ""humor"", per se? No doubt it leaves a bleak and bitter taste in my mouth. The endless and futile bureaucracy generates more incensed frustration in my boiling blood regarding injustice (the arrest), corruption (the painter's loopholes of court acquittals) and unaccountability (the guards) than it leaves me humorously accepting the way the world really is (and has been for centuries). So to the degree you take Kafka and such unexplainable ""Kafkaesque"" situations at pure face value, perhaps it can provide a little respite and somehow bring us together in a mutual futility? Sigh."
The Trial,4,"May 5, 2024","Even after reading Metamorphosis and knowing about Kafkaesque I thought it was a courtroom drama full of secrets and arguments but hell no this is completely different. There are only problems with no solutions, so how do you expect to get answers?"
The Trial,4,"April 18, 2025",definitely kafkaesque. 4 stars!
The Trial,4,"April 8, 2015","Of having written so little and so incomplete, its a wonder his name is now used as a means to describe nightmarish and ominous situations. Kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"April 18, 2016","Kafka's short stories are the edgy and brilliant work of a troubled genius; he remains one my favorite short story writers ever. The Trial was my first foray into his novels, and I chose to start with his most famous work. Apparently The Trial was written in 1914, not published till after Kafka's death, and may not actually have been completed. This is one of those books for which the title, and even the author's name, have become metaphors for entire concepts. Although there was some of his usual brilliance, there were a lot of rough edges in the story, and the book was not as powerful or affecting as I expected. Perhaps because the book was unfinished, or the long form wasn't Kafka's strength, it wasn't a smooth read. But while reading, I also wondered about the translation (beyond small quibbles, e.g., retaining German honorifics, which is not uncommon but has always puzzled me). There are many valid theories of translation, but for the mind to be wandering while reading and wondering about the translation is never good. Unable to read German (my loss), I'm at the mercy of the translator (Breon Mitchell, here), and now I wonder if it's worthwhile to read the Muirs' version. Mitchell cites that often the Muirs smoothed away difficulties (at some cost), which makes me wonder if I would prefer a ""smoother"" version, since I'm unable to determine which translation is more accurate. I think The Trial is one of those books for which the plot, much like The Picture of Dorian Gray, is well known even to people who've never read it. The story itself, one man against an unreasoning and inflexible bureaucracy, so much a Franz Kafka theme, remains as relevant now as it was then, although the particulars did seem somewhat dated, distant, or parochial. Still, that didn't stop my appreciation of The Trial as a whole. It was very good book in its Kafkaesque way. I'm glad I read The Trial, and may read it again, but next time I'll try a different translation. [4 Stars]"
The Trial,4,"January 31, 2018","1.	If you read the entry for the book in Wikipedia, you will see: “it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader.” Something similar is said by a lot of the reviews here. “The nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader”. Well, that’s obviously true. But I don’t think that’s the point. K doesn’t sound very interested in knowing what was his crime. Of course, all along the book we read that he doesn’t know why is he prosecuted. But he tries to get rid of it, if any, not to find out anything. No one tries to find out anything. No one tries to find out anything important, at least. The story goes over different stories, and almost all of them are “analog” one to another. With his neighbor, with the owner of the house, with the friend of the neighbor, with his uncle, with his lawyer. Etcetera. There is no development of anything. I think that’s the point. K doesn’t learn anything during the process, that’s what we learn. He gets all the time stuck. But he’s not stuck in finding out why is prosecuted! He gets stuck in non-sense. Gets stuck in small missions he decides for himself. Obviously it’s a book about burocracy. Yes, of course it’s about authoritarianism and non-sense and all the kafkaesque words. But it’s also a book about neurosis. That is also something very Kafkaesque. The burocracy gets K in the process; the neurosis doesn’t allow him to get rid of it. The authority decides he’s in the process, and there’s nothing he can do. The authority decides he’s guilty, and there’s nothing he can do. K tries to be hiper-rational and because of that he finishes being the less rational possible, just giving himself to death."
The Trial,2,"December 13, 2012","The problem with Franz Kafka is that people give him too much agency. People either call works of fiction Kafkaesque, or if not, say 'It's certainly no Kafka', as if he is the be all end all of literature, or perhaps even life. Earlier this year I read an article in the Meanjin that blamed Kafka for the death of his sister Ottla at Auschwitz, even though he was dead over a decade before World War II and years before the Hitler came into power. The writer of the article seemed to believe that Kafka was either a precog or some omniscient being that must've known, somehow, that there would be a genocide of the Jewish people, and basically that he was a disappointment and maybe even a horrible person because he did not tell his sister that (I'm seriously wondering how this article even got published it is so horrible)."
The Trial,4,"October 21, 2010","Disorienting, disconcerting, and, disappointingly, unfinished. (I'm starting to wonder whether kafkaesque should mean 'not finished' rather than surreal.)"
The Trial,3,"November 4, 2015","This novel might be more famous for its basic scenario (Kafkaesque bureaucracy) than the actual plot, characters, scenes, etc. Other than a few small bits (the first and last chapters, the cathedral parable), few talk about the scenes or the characters. Most discussions are about the general situation that K finds himself in."
The Trial,4,"May 16, 2021","All in all, this book is, literally, quite Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"October 16, 2023","It is doubtless that Kafka's works never fail to capture a reader. From The Metamorphosis to Amerika, Kafka has provided bibliophiles with fleshy and fruitful tales for generations. However, The Trial, one of Kafka's previously unfinished works, which he even demanded to have burned after his death, has remained the closest to my heart. Not only is the captivating Kafkaesque style employed beautifully throughout this tale, but of course, Kafka's renowned and juicy social commentary is also incepted within this novel."
The Trial,Not rated,"February 19, 2013","The word “Kafkaesque” comes from the author Franz Kafka and it refers to the style in which he wrote his book, the Trial included. It basically describes a nightmarish situation in which people can relate. The character seems to be trapped in this situation which they cannot escape and which is beyond their control. In this case, Josef K who is the main character in this novel is abruptly arrested one morning by two men who are not in uniform, for a crime which was never explained to him or the reader. Despite his efforts at petitioning the government and talking to various people who all have varying degrees of influence and knowledge about the trial, he is unable to find out even the slightest bit of information as to why he is on trial, and as his lawyer tells him, the government does not put people on trial unless they are sure of their guilt. This was probably the most frustrating book to me; not knowing why K was in that situation and if the reader would find out or not. On the other hand, I thought that it showed a good portrayal of a totalitarian society where the authority which was the court system in this book, had power to persecute individuals presentations of situations paradoxically magnifying the craziness situation that they were in. I also thought that the book seemed like a satire against the corrupt bureaucrats. The warders claim to know nothing beside the fact that he was arrested and asked to report in front of a magistrate. The plot of the novel is loose and uninteresting, though the style in which it is presented is good. The undertone of the main character and even Kafka himself was definitely shown in the novel, giving the reader that feeling of isolation and alienation from the society he was in. It was a bit tedious at times, but over all I think that this was an ok book."
The Trial,5,"February 21, 2014","Some will love the nonsensical chronicle we are taken on in The Trial, with its struggles and victories and encounters with frustrating characters; Kafka is one of those Marmite writers either detested or worshiped by his readers. However, it is the license of the reader is to make sense of the nonsense, the allegorical mystery we are presented with, the clues of which can be interpreted into any solution. Such is the sinister nature of Kafka that makes him so, well…‘Kafkaesque’."
The Trial,2,"July 22, 2018",Kafkaesque.
The Trial,4,"February 16, 2025","This is the one book that I am very confused about as far as rating it is concerned. It's one of it's kind and is the first of Kafka that I read. I really don't know what to say but admit that it's atmosphere is Kafkaesque even when I doubt what that word means. I almost feel like leaving it without a rating, not that I didn't like it because if I had disliked it, it would have made it easier for me to rate it."
The Trial,5,"January 20, 2008","Reading Kafka is what I imagine it would be like to listen while someone narrated their own dream if one had such coherent dreams. The environments within Kafka's stories are always eerie and established just to the point of being dream-like, but the situations in ""The Trial"" are a lot more physically aware than the ones in his other unfinished novel ""The Castle."" For example there is a scene where he is in the lobby attic of the court house and he is being suffocated by the air and stuffiness of the people and boarded up rooms. This undoubtedly made me physically uncomfortable. This is one reason that the term Kafkaesque is such a poignant word. Which is to say that his stories are almost always extremely oppressive in there qualities and most certainly nightmarish in there constant shifting state. I have always thought that his short stories were most successful in their execution and lyrical rhythm, but having finally read ""The Trial"" I can easily say that his novels resonate with the same qualities and are successful in their own ways."
The Trial,4,"April 13, 2011","Still, highly recommended, it is a true work of literature that, having created a whole realm of fiction under the epithet 'Kafkaesque' transcends the normal boundaries of fiction and is both horror, dark fantasy, and literary at the same time (see my review ofMetropole by Ferenc Karinthy, the contemporary Hungarian writer, for the one genuinely remarkable successor to Kafak and his The Trial for its atmosphere alone)."
The Trial,3,"April 23, 2020","Anyone who is familiar with satirical and/or absurdist literature, along with anyone who is intrigued by the best known authoritarian setting oft-described as Orwellian, should be familiar with that which is characterised in literature as 'Kafkaesque.' Although familiar, until a couple of days ago I had yet to read Kakfa. I began with The Trial - a novel which details the journey of Joseph K., a man who is arrested without charge by an unidentified authority. As a result of the ensuring trial, K. experiences a nauseating descent in his quality of life, with endless and ever-worsening disorientation over the process surrounding his farcical legal predicament."
The Trial,4,"January 18, 2016","The novel is a conflict between a man’s fate and the contradictions of the rules made by man that are not transparent as they seem to be. I have been told that most of us are too involved with ourselves that we do not realize that we in fact, are living Kafkaesque moments or that we simply choose to ignore."
The Trial,5,"October 27, 2021","If there is a poet laureate of the literature of paranoia, those laurels belong without any doubt to Bohemian/Czech author Franz Kafka. Not only have his mostly posthumously published works directly or indirectly inspired most novels about paranoia, even his name has become synonymous with the bizarre, the labyrinthian, and the inexplicably tortuous (and torturous) windings of bureaucracies and conspiracies in the words “kafkaesque” and “kafkan.” In this, his best-known longer work, we meet the unfortunate Josef K., who wakes one morning to find two agents from an unidentified agency in his apartment there to arrest him. For what crime? That’s exactly what poor Josef spends most of this novel trying to figure out. He’s drawn through a ridiculously long and seemingly meaningless process in a system already determined to find him guilty. This novel is often seen as a sort of prefiguration or even premonition of the horrors of the Stalinist and Hitlerian regimes with their mass arrests and liquidations, but Kafka can also be seen as pointing to a deeper flaw in humans in general, one that leaves us with a haunting feeling of being guilty of some crime we can barely understand.."
The Trial,4,"July 12, 2024","Before reading this novel, I knew Kafka as the writer of ""The Metamorphosis"" (which I think has the best opening line in all of literature). I have heard the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" used frequently, but did not understand it until now. I am a long-time viewer of ""Law and Order: SVU"", a show that regularly showcases the flaws and corruption in the judicial system. But SVU has nothing on Kafka - in fact, it seems rather tame by comparison. I won't give a synopsis because this is not an easy book to summarize (partly because it is unfinished and partly because of the themes)."
The Trial,4,"September 4, 2023","That aside, such a great statement about what actually defines a ""civilized"" society - and this was written over a century ago. ""Kafkaesque"" has since been added to my vocabulary, and now comes to mind as apt way too often. I may not be a flat out post-modernist, but this book reminds me that we've crossed from a functional, just society into something else in may ways."
The Trial,4,"August 23, 2008","Everyone is probably familiar with the concept of The Trial: A man (""K.""), much to his surprise, is ""arrested"" one morning before breakfast and informed that he will be tried for certain unstated crimes in a secret court with secret laws. He is allowed no official legal representation, and (as far as anyone can say) everyone who is tried is found guilty. Naturally, this mysterious trial becomes his obsession and his work and social life suffer. K. seems to unwittingly make his situation worse at every step. As a reader, it is a little hard to feel sorry for K. - he is not a very sympathetic character - but then again he is thrust into a difficult situation not of his making. I'm going to go out on a limb here, and use my literary analysis skills. This is not a story about the liberal and humanist failings of secretive authoritarian governments. Rather, the trial itself is a metaphor for life, in which we are all being judged for failings we are not aware of using rules we cannot comprehend. We are all going to be found guilty, and eventually we all face punishment. Deep. This story is a little difficult to read because, I think, it was never really finished. It has an ending, but it just doesn't seem polished. You should read it, however, just so that when you refer to the Bush administration's policy of indefinite detention of enemy combatants, secret laws, secret courts, and secret trials, you can call them Kafkaesque without pretension."
The Trial,5,"September 10, 2007","Yes. With The Trial, Kafka manages to build up a compelling case for his being the man. I'm going to have to also read The Castle. Actually, I'm sort of embarrassed that I hadn't already read The Trial, it had been on my list for a long long time, but it always kept getting pushed down the list by other things. But I'm glad I finally got around to it--a more or less perfect expression of my own distaste for bureaucracy. I still think people who use the word ""kafkaesque"" are really pretentious though. People who use that word don't use it because it accurately describes an idea they're trying to get across, the real meaning they're trying to get across is ""hey everyone, look at me! I must be really smart and sophisticated because I just used the word kafkaesque!"" They should be subjected to painfully horrible deaths in the very near future. But I digress. The Trial was really well done in how it managed to walk this fine line where it went into excruciating detail on really tedious minutiae of the inner workings of the court and the trial, but was still fascinating because as readers we're shaking our heads and thinking how the real world is scarily like that sometimes, in that we get sucked into these senseless labyrinths of paperwork and arbitrary regulations and red tape and are forced to immerse ourselves in them because otherwise something we need would be denied to us."
The Trial,5,"June 11, 2024","My first Kafka book, and let me tell you, he is not easy to read. Sometimes, it feels like the whole story is a fever dream, touching on the abstract. However, I can affirm that it is a great book that will help you identify Kafkaesque scenarios in your day-to-day life, which is quite scary."
The Trial,Not rated,"July 11, 2025","The First 5 - Okay. I feel as confused as K. But I think that's the point. I haven't read much Kafka, but the pace and use of time feels Kafkaesque. I'm intrigued. I'm expecting that details will slowly emerge."
The Trial,4,"August 3, 2015","I can finally say I've read my first Kafka. Some might say this is less a book/novel than a 'stream of consciousness' experiment. I fully admit that I now understand why the term ""Kafkaesque"" exists. I can only judge the term by this book, but I came away feeling like I was part of the narrative. I've had nightmares before about wandering into an undefined space, recognizing it one way--only to see it transformed to something disturbing and altered a moment later. This story features many of those same moments."
The Trial,3,"August 20, 2016","I am hesitant to write a review of this book because throughout the book, I often failed to grasp the deep, multi-layered meaning of Kafka's metaphors and ideas. I found myself rereading passages multiple times, being able to grasp only that what I was reading was more nuanced and needed more analysis than I was able to grapple with. I suppose I know better understand the meaning of ""Kafkaesque"".That being said, I imagine this is the experience of most readers of The Trial, due to the sheer volume of symbolism and social commentary packed into this 200 page book. The tone of this book is dark and morose, making it impossible to say that it is an enjoyable read, but it has moments that call for pause such as:"
The Trial,4,"September 26, 2019","The Trial is not just a book, but a cultural icon; Kafka is not just a writer but a mindset—“Kafkaesque.” Here, Everyman Josef K is persecuted by a mysterious and sadistic Law, which has condemned him in advance for a crime of which he knows nothing. Modern anxieties are given near-archetypal form in this parable that seems both to foretell the totalitarian societies to come and to mourn our alienation from a terrible Old Testament God."
The Trial,5,"November 14, 2023","- (SPOILERS) This novel was a slow burn for me. It hooked me from the moment the novel began with the police charging K with an unknown crime. Throughout the duration of the novel, I was constantly trying to guess where the conclusion would lead. I expected him to be sent to jail, or for him to be let go for no reason, or for him to finally discover what crime he had committed. This left me both shocked and a tiny bit unsatisfied with the ending. But in retrospect and after thinking about it for some time, I realize that the ending was inevitable. I love Kafkaesque narratives and the way he is able to deconstruct society and humanity through absurd scenarios. ‘Metamorphosis’ is a prime example of him criticizing his society and the state of the working class but in ‘The Trial’ Kafka is able to do the same with the human experience and the philosophy of the absurd. The story (like life) is absurd, it makes no sense, it is frustrating, it is convoluted, it teases answers yet never gives them, and will leave you dying cold and confused. It is an exceptionally bleak novel but it is also powerful in how unapologetically cruel it is."
The Trial,4,"December 6, 2021","I must confess, this was the book that got me back into reading but not for reasons you'd expect. I was a little obsessed with the word ""kafkaesque"" from its use in pop-culture, even though I hardly even understood what it meant. I found this book on the shelf of a tiny downtown Dallas book store and knew I had to finally understand about what this word meant."
The Trial,4,"May 30, 2022","The concept though, is a charming yet grim look at the absurd process of complex bureaucracy. To me this book was a criticism of religion and original sin. The main character is judged for a crime no one can explain and must repent at the court on a weekly basis. Other convicts grovel on their knees to lawyers and nothing is ever resolved till an accused dies. This interpretation though is probably due to my athiesm and distaste for the christian church. I imagine another reader would see it as a critique of government or the perils of entering an adult world or even more literally, the legal system. The sign of good art is that it can mean different things to different people. Still though, a charming read and a nice demonstration of the kafkaesque."
The Trial,4,"September 17, 2022",Kafkaesque. A term adopted by the modern literature as a descriptive word depicting the world that very much draws its inspiration from this book. The protagonist in this book finds himself involved in a case. For no apparent reason and with no explaination of the case and his predicament. This sets the stage for author's analysis of what an authoritarian world looks like and just how the instrument that stands for justice if blinded could turn as a tool of oppression. The writing and narrative is grim which I think helps in conveying the themes of the book. This is not a traditional novel: It forgoes traditional plot checkpoints of climax and resolution so if you were expecting that you might be disappointed. It relies far more on the narrative building than on telling facts of a story. The Trial is considered as a classic and Kafka's greatest work. It certainly warrants a read as a stand alone book but more so as a literary behemoth which would influence literature for years to come.
The Trial,5,"March 17, 2023","This book proves that there is more to the ‘Kafkaesque’ than the absurd and surreal. There is also a grounding, machine-like truth to the ideas and tales he produces. As strange and suffocating as K.’s life seems to be, so too is it very real. Every mention of the trial or the court induces within him a sweltering heat that is shown in the long-winded sentences we read along the page."
The Trial,5,"February 13, 2025",Kafkaesque
The Trial,4,"January 20, 2014","When people use the adjective 'Kafkaesque', it is The Trial they have in mind - the nightmarish world of Joseph K., where the rules are hidden from even the highest officials, and any help there may be comes from unexpected sources. K. is never told what he is on trial for, and when he says he is innocent, he is immediately asked 'innocent of what?' Is he perhaps on trial for his innocence? Could he have freed himself from the proceedings by confessing his guilt as a human being? Has the trial been set up because he is incapable of admitting his guilt, and hence his humanity? The Trial is a chilling and at the same time blackly amusing tale that maintains, to the very end, a constant, relentless atmosphere of disorientation and quirkiness. Superficially the subject-matter is bureaucracy, but the story's great strength is its description of the effect on the life and mind of Josef K. It is in the last resort a description of the absurdity of 'normal' human nature."
The Trial,3,"January 2, 2018","Another one I should have read years ago. This was well done, the epitome of ""Kafkaesque"" of course, and it really did get me emotionally involved even 100 years later and in a very different country. He had a very typical, misogynist way of writing all the women, which was frustrating at times (which is what knocks it down to 3 stars, I'm so over women being written that way, I'm just less and less willing to look past it these days). But it almost felt like being in a dream where weird things appear behind doorways and you never quite understand what is happening. Which was very engaging, and of course it's a classic that influenced a lot of 20th century fiction. Good read, glad I finally got to it."
The Trial,3,"September 28, 2023","I finally experienced ""Kafkaesque"" - ""nightmarishly complex, bizarre or illogical quality""."
The Trial,5,"August 19, 2011",kafkaesque to the extreme.
The Trial,5,"February 16, 2014","This reading of The Trial also had considerably more farce and humor, especially in all of the descriptions of minutiae, and felt more like a successor to Gogol than I had previously remembered. And it is also a reminder that just about everything that anyone terms Kafkaesque is capturing at most one or two facets of the very multidimensional, strange original combination that Kafka himself provided."
The Trial,5,"March 8, 2012","This is my first introduction to Kafka and I think I'm a little closer to understanding what 'Kafkaesque' really means. This is definitely a surrealist work of art! Sure it's vague in its intentions but I enjoyed it all the more for it. What is this tale really about? Isolation? Corruption? The alienation of the individual in society? The true meaning of Law or Justice? I think all of the above, which explains why this is such an important book. Like Orwell and Huxley, Kafka invites us to question where are we going, where will this end?"
The Trial,4,"July 22, 2017","Reading and liking Kafka isn't the same as reading and liking books that are fun or easy to read or stimulating. There's a mustiness and oppressiveness and malaise in The Trial that seeps through every page until the final ""like a dog"" at the end. It also doesn't feel like an original idea - that Bureaucracy is overwhelming and omnipotent - yet two short novels gave us ""Kafkaesque"" to describe the impotence of a common man facing the machine."
The Trial,3,"October 24, 2015","I really like the concept of this book, but it was difficult to stay engaged. I never related to the main character or the world in which this story occurs. My problem may have been that I compared it to Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon, which has a similar premise of a person being imprisoned suddenly and trying to discover why he is there. The main difference in storytelling narrative is that while Koestler's book is tangible and weaves the character's story as the chapters unfold, Kafka is less interested in what the main character does or did in the past, and rather more abstractly on the story world itself. I can understand and appreciate the term Kafkaesque now as a world involving heaps of cold bureaucracy layered to remove the human element and an uncaring world. Overall, the book had interesting themes but I didn't enjoy reading it much."
The Trial,4,"May 20, 2015","‘Kafkaesque’ is defined as the helplessness of man in the face of unknown forces that persecute him without reason. In Kafka’s The Trial, Joseph K. is persecuted by the Law (symbolized by the Court) and is not given a reason for his arrest. The entire court system of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I is parodied, as well as the police, who are portrayed as a ‘theater’ act; they were open to bribery and corruption of all sorts while conducting legal procedures that made no sense. Along with this central theme, the novel also denotes the alienation and anxiety of humanity in general ‘in the absence of God’ as revealed by other existentialists such as: Sartre, Camus, Dostoevsky and Kierkegard. This is an excerpt of a book review written by myself for a University literature class."
The Trial,5,"June 2, 2025","my biggest mistake was choosing to read this book after years of not reading anything by kafka. i was confused until i realized that the ""kafkaesque"" world of the trial wasn't supposed to make sense."
The Trial,2,"November 18, 2008","This is the only Kafka I've ever read, and I suppose I don't appreciate the ""Kafkaesque,"" but this book just didn't do it for me. I found finishing it sort of a chore. I can definitely appreciate the story and the social commentary - the plot (about a man trapped in an unknowable court system on a mystery charge) is certainly intriguing and thoughtful - but it just seemed to go on and to set forth the absurd for its own sake (which I guess is sort of the point). I don't think my read of this was helped by the fact that I read this for a course, in which we spent a lot of time dissecting the plot in ways I thought didn't always make sense. In any event, I think I'm done with Kafka for a while."
The Trial,4,"September 25, 2011",I'm not sure if I enjoyed this book - I'm not even sure that I could coherently explain the plot. But I occasionally come across the adjective 'Kafkaesque' to describe something unbelievable or nightmarish. Now I have a better understanding of what that means! Excellent audiobook narration by George Guidall.
The Trial,5,"February 6, 2016","The hopelessness of fighting against a totalitarian enemy, 'Kafkaesque' as they say is is portrayed in a way only Kafka can."
The Trial,4,"April 3, 2016","The Trial by Kafka is a dark story about the legal system, bureaucracy , hierarchical systems of the society and the deeply disturbing sense of loneliness a man find himself in the entanglement of all these. I often have read the word , kafkaesque on the internet but this is the first time I experienced reading his work. The story lays bare the dark realty of justice delivery , corruption of man and the corresponding decay of the institution. I found much similarity between this work with Camus's Stranger , wherein both protagonists are detached from the usual societal order and in someways are a rebelling against it."
The Trial,5,"November 30, 2016","It is very difficult to read a book when you have had decades of it entering your consciousness through references and discussion. However, after taking a trip to Prague in 2015 and with an upcoming Smithsonian lecture on Kafka in December, I decided it was time I actually read THE TRIAL. After deciding which translation to buy I dove in and found myself a little put off at first. As I continued to read I got a feel for the writing and the style. I was impressed by the way the book makes you feel like you are lost in this unfathomable and unknowable situation. You give up the idea of logic and regular problem solving and just go along with Josef K. on his bizarre journey. Kafkaesque indeed."
The Trial,4,"February 2, 2009",Now I know what people mean when they say Kafkaesque. This was truely a weird book. Man put on trial for some unammed offense that he never learns about and what he trys to do to defend himself. This probably can be interpretted to mean many different things depending on ones own views going in.
The Trial,4,"June 22, 2009","This book was a cross between Alice in Wonderland and The Game, a movie directed by David Fincher and starring Michael Douglas. This book was recommended to me by my friend Creig. In addition, while reading the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, my stepfather came across the term ""Kafkaesque"" and called me to ask if I knew the meaning. After our conversation where I stated that I did not know the term, the thought to research the meaning began to wane until it was revived by my friend Creig who suggested that I should read the book."
The Trial,4,"December 25, 2009","At least as I understood it, The Trial is a black comedy that contrasts the disconnectedness of individuals from larger societal agencies. As governments and corporations have become larger and more powerful, the world has become increasingly Kafkaesque, surreal and full of bewildering mini-trials to accompany their big-brother trials. Humans evolved under social conditions where tribal elders were accessible, but mass culture leaves people isolated and disempowered, and unable to form relationships of reciprocal influence. Kafka portrays all this in a way that reveals the absurdity of the modern individual's plight."
The Trial,4,"March 5, 2015","Interesting, from a lawyer's perspective is remarkably lean on details of the proceeding itself (and there are so many 'Kafkaesque' aspects of actual/non-fictional legal process that the omission seems strange). Obviously that's the point -- as I talk to my clients and try to discern what they need to know that is not obvious and that I'm not telling them (and what they did not know during a past experience with legal system), I see the parallels in Josef K.'s odyssey. Quite subjective, murky, even a bit dreamlike, earns its ubiquitous place on university English (uh, Euro.) literature syllabi."
The Trial,4,"September 16, 2016","I will certainly revisit this when i am older, because there are surely things that i didn't pick up on and probably never will. the book is very entertaining, and also gives the reader a sense of uneasiness or anxiety. this book really defines the word: kafkaesque. i would like to have a word to named after me but i wonder if he would want one after his. nevertheless this is a must read, something on every learned man's library (not to say that i am learned). its seems futile writing this because those who have read this will not be impressed and those who haven't will probably never read the story anyway."
The Trial,5,"November 5, 2016","The word ""Kafkaesque"" wasn't derived from Franz Kafka and his writings for nothing."
The Trial,4,"July 14, 2025","✔""The trial"" the story of man who left a concept of alienation heightened the sense of hopelessness and just the sheer absurdity of the unfair trial and execution, and it leaves so many questions unanswered, including who was that person behind the window observing Josef’s stabbing? It is indeed nightmarish and illogical, a common theme in Kafka’s writings that have since dubbed as “Kafkaesque.”"
The Trial,3,"August 17, 2008","I always wanted to know the exact definition of Kafkaesque, like other name words like hectoring, quisling, zamboni. So, I decided to read The Trial."
The Trial,3,"June 11, 2024","For the most part I found this book quite simply, ridiculous in its surrealism. To the point that it is almost comical. I would compare it to appreciating a piece of modern art.. You can't quite make out what it is or what it means.. you might like it or hate it or possibly even just be neutral about it. But the value of it comes more from the viewer, or in this case, the reader's interpretation of it. Am I glad I read it though? Well, of course. Kafka after all is a classic and at least now I can definitively say I understand what it means to say that something is Kafkaesque.."
The Trial,3,"February 22, 2010","The 2nd UFM book club book. Quite a bit shorter and to me, less intense, than an Ayn Rand book. How can anyone not describe a book of Kafka as Kafkaesque?"
The Trial,Not rated,"May 5, 2010","I picked up 'The Trial' because I wanted to know the story behind the word ""kafkaesque"". I also love reading literature written by a local author when I'm visiting a new city/town/village. The book actually took me back to India in a strange way where bureaucracy can crush your soul and burn your brain till you don't really know if its you or the world thats gone mad. It takes great skill to write in an interesting way about the confusing corridors of power and bureaucracy and to make the frustrations of that experience get under the readers skin. Kafka does it well."
The Trial,5,"June 6, 2012","I interpret this (as many have) as an allegory for the ironical condition of the modern man, who feels guilty but doesn't know where he has sinned; to whom religion is an accessible yet fruitless and tedious option; and who in the end succumbs to his guilt without really understanding why. The protagonist attempts to find meaning in his whole ""trial"", but fails at every step of the bureaucratic process. If you ever wondered what 'Kafkaesque' meant, this novel is the living definition of that term."
The Trial,3,"September 9, 2012","Kafka makes my stomach hurt and gives me nightmares. Upon reading him years ago I felt somewhat damaged; I thought at first it was just a bruise, but no, it turns out to be a bit more than that. Nevertheless, unlike so many other novels, The Trial, Metamorphosis, are seared into one's memory. This is felicitous as one need never reread him without some highly compelling reason to do so. Also, without Kafka, we would never be able to label anything as being Kafkaesque, which would be inconvenient."
The Trial,4,"November 8, 2013","Real life is really Kafkaesque... Furthermore, the story felt so unreal, in times of Brazilian ""embargos infringentes""... And then I realized that using our so boasted about ""creativity"", Brazilian justice system complemented Titorelli´s ""definitive absolution - absolvição real""; ""fake absolution - absolvição aparente"" e ""infinite postponement - dilação infinita"", we have created an additional forth way to scape the process (similar to the last one, but more efficient to the criminal defendant."
The Trial,4,"December 16, 2015","Well, who is more Kafkaesque than the Kafkster himself? The book did a few things for me. (1) It really made me appreciate rules of criminal and civil procedure and the administrative procedures act, in general. (2) It made me appreciate indictments, accusations, and fact pleading, in particular. (3) It made me question why traffic court is the only court in town that requires payment for parking, and why the most important room, where all payments are made, is neither numbered nor easily located. Brilliant work by the world's most surreal writer."
The Trial,1,"March 6, 2022","Couldn't finish it, this is one crazy book. However, I now understand when someone says something is Kafkaesque!!"
The Trial,2,"February 25, 2023",Always wondered what kafkaesque is
The Trial,3,"February 15, 2008","One thing it truly delivers, though, is an example of what I've seen referred to as ""kafkaesque"". As such, I suppose it broadens both your view of the world. Or something."
The Trial,5,"April 30, 2010","A great example, not only of what a fine author Kafka was, but what an impact his intuitive legal background has had on his writing style. What has to be understood is that Kafka is depicting a state of true legal terror, a Kafkaesque denial of rights that should chill anyone who fears the wrath of a totalitarian regime. K.'s predicament is shown with such frightening indeterminacy of our law so as to show Kafka's true feelings as to the possibilities of our sovereign governments."
The Trial,3,"November 25, 2011","I needed/wanted to read this book for myself because I had heard the term ""kafkaesque"" used enough times and although explained to me - I needed to go to the source."
The Trial,4,"February 11, 2014","I really enjoyed the book and encourage others to read, but if reading an english translation, steer clear of the David Wyllie version, which is riddled with inappropriate grammar and syntax. Had I done research before purchasing this edition, I would have bought another's version. But aside from that, the story itself typifies the 'Kafkaesque"" experience. I look forward to reading an alternative translation in the future."
The Trial,1,"December 29, 2014","If you ever want to read something that makes you want to punch someone in the face... Well here you go. I enjoyed The Metamorphosis and I think The Trial was a little more ""Kafkaesque"" which I found utterly irritating this time around. Perhaps I am a little too left-brained to enjoy this; first book to make my ""Putrid List""."
The Trial,2,"September 28, 2015","I'm shocked I did not enjoy it. I love all of Kafka's other works and the premise of a man being charged with a crime of which he is never informed had me intrigued. I thought that the mysterious ""Kafkaesque"" bureaucracy that operates by its own rules depicted in the novel would terrify me. But, it didn't. Kafka is best when he writes short stories and novellas. Allowed to wander over many pages, Kafka's unfinished novel is slow and leads the reader down some paths that go nowhere."
The Trial,Not rated,"February 7, 2017",to read because curious about the summary that will be presented in TED ed video on kafkaesque definition (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkPR4...)
The Trial,4,"June 21, 2021","It was a great dark satirical read, and Kafkaesque, as it is said :-)"
The Trial,3,"July 20, 2022","Intriguing Kafkaesque plot as seen in metamorphosis where Gregor wakes up one day transformed into a ‘monstrous vermin’ , in this book Josef K wakes up one day to an arrest. Explores how the common man can be affected by society, politics and law involuntarily, without provocation and on an ordinary day."
The Trial,3,"June 1, 2022","The copy I had was from the 1988 edition and was different from most audio versions out there. At first I really enjoyed the writing because it reminded me of the long monologue writing style similar to The Idiot by Dostoevsky. I got about 2/3 of the way in before just absolutely checking out because of how pointless and disconnected the writing felt. This is after all my first Kafka book, so perhaps this is my first definition to what Kafkaesque really means: boring."
The Trial,3,"June 15, 2023","I think I need to read it again. I feel like I missed something. No complaints though. One interesting side effect of reading ""The Trial""; a few years ago I read ""The Unconsoled"" by Ishiguro, and I struggled to explain the literary style to a friend. It turns out the well known ""kafkaesque"" style exactly describes what I felt when I read Ishiguro's work. In this sense, reading The Trial was helpful."
The Trial,3,"June 23, 2025","ok so the only reason i put this at 3 stars and no higher is because i really didn’t enjoy his style. like it wasn’t enjoyable FOR ME. i loved how to book made me think and i understand completely why it is studied and praised but it got to a point in reading where i was dreading it, which is totally on me. but other than that great like yeah ok i get the kafkaesque vibes n shit"
The Trial,4,"May 7, 2008","The word Kafkaesque, when referring to a convoluted, quixotic experience in the legal system comes from this book. Like 1984, a book that's enriched the language compels a reader to it."
The Trial,4,"August 10, 2008",I am very pleased to have read this book and in a strange way I enjoyed reading it. At least I understand the work 'Kafkaesque' a bit better now ^_^
The Trial,5,"November 5, 2009","I was reluctant to read this because of the pervasiveness of that wildly overused word, Kafkaesque. What could the source material reveal that I did not divine from the ubiquity of this word? Simplistic, yes. But so was my reaction to this book, which is the surest sign of Kafka's greatness. What control! What detailing! What humor! What vitality! What originality! Genius."
The Trial,5,"March 10, 2012","The book that gives meaning to ""Kafkaesque"" - a bank clerk arrested and to be tried for an undisclosed crime that he is not allowed to learn, in an unknowable and unending legal process with corrupt judges, and with relatives, lawyers and acquaintances all giving him different advice. Though 100 years old, the story is as current and chilling as when it was written."
The Trial,2,"June 14, 2011","It was a struggle. The writing style was tedious, and I kept trying to make sense of the plot, only to realize that was exactly the point of the story. But, unlike the main character, I did not live up the Kafkaesque challenge of struggling to the end. I bailed out halfway through and read instead the graphic novel. It was the perfect format for this book!"
The Trial,3,"January 21, 2012","I thought I reviewed this already but I guess it didn't save. I only read this because the term ""kafkaesque is used all the time. The writing wasn't that great but it did demonstrate an important part of privacy. That is the ability to control your personal information, know what information about you is held by others, and how that information is being used."
The Trial,5,"September 22, 2013","I now understand the meaning of the word ""Kafkaesque"". Great read!"
The Trial,4,"June 28, 2016","The completion of this book marks an end to an epoch in my life. With more than 2 years, 2 books and quite a few journeys. It is a mellowed down version of kafkaesque but still potent with the arbitrary, inexplicable &amp; convoluted to the wits end. It engrosses you into the characters and their idiosyncrasies."
The Trial,4,"October 1, 2014",And I have felt how excruciating Kafkaesque (processes) is while reading the book.
The Trial,4,"April 11, 2015","A weird trip into bureaucracy that gets stranger and more disturbing with every page. The definition of ""Kafkaesque"". The only shame is that the book was left unfinished. I couldn't help but feel there were still some even crazier thoughts left hanging about in Kafka's mind. Maybe it's better that way?"
The Trial,5,"June 7, 2015","Oh man, I am coo-coo for Kafka - love it so much, so amazingly written, combining quirky humor with relentless vexation, never quite hopeless, but then again there's no reason for hope, either, as he might say. Great stuff. If you've ever used the word Kafkaesque --and who hasn't?-- you owe it to yourself to read this or The Castle, IMO, YMMV, etc."
The Trial,2,"July 29, 2024","I was very disappointed. Having read ‘Metamorphosis’, which I thought was excellent, and having been a keen student of the “Kafkaesque”, I had high hopes for ‘The Trial’. Sadly, apart from the interesting core theme, I found the book leaden and uninspiring, and only persevered with it because it was by Kafka."
The Trial,4,"April 3, 2020","I thoroughly enjoyed The Trial in the start, the last chapter, however, does not seem to be written by Kafka himself but some Kafkaesque professor. It feels very abrupt, almost like it doesn't belong there. If it was written by Kafka then the preceding chapters are lost as the second last chapter seems not to precede the last. Even still a great novel."
The Trial,3,"May 3, 2008","I have a beautiful edition of this book from the 1950s. That's what I like about this book. If you're into ""kafkaesque"" literature, you're better off reading ""Metamorphosis"", ""the castle"" or ""the penal colony and other stories"". These are better examples of his style and outlook on society."
The Trial,3,"December 4, 2009","Now I can use the term ""Kafkaesque"" &amp; have first-hand knowledge of its meaning! The poor man finds himself in truly bizarre situations where the normal rules do not apply and he does not know how to proceed. Very nightmarish."
The Trial,2,"March 30, 2011","The Trial was my frist Kafka. I picked it up because I was sick of being out of the loop when something was described as ""Kafkaesque"". Wikipedia says the term describes something ""marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity."" Sounds about right. I didn't care for this book."
The Trial,4,"September 27, 2011","Had to read this book for school a while ago, have yet to re-read it. The class was on modernity and i think the focus was meant to be bureaucracy. Full of surreal imagery and symbolism. I learnt what the term ""Kafkaesque"" meant. Was my second Kafka book, first of course was Metamorphoses."
The Trial,5,"March 15, 2012","This is a mesmerizing fictional account of a man charged with a crime but is never told what the crime is. if you have ever heard the term ""Kafkaesque"" but wasn't sure what it meant, this book will explain it."
The Trial,5,"July 5, 2019","Kafka revealed the possibilities of fiction to my much younger self, and continues to do so to this day. I highly recommend this translation of his greatest extended fiction over the earlier one by the Muirs. A great novel, truly Kafkaesque."
The Trial,5,"February 15, 2013","My favorite Kafka-book, although it wasn't my first. The Trial is a fairly easy read, (if you're not put off by Kafkaesque). It takes a look at the workings of the political system, the law and the impossibility of justice. If you don't like bugs, THIS is a classica Kafka must-read."
The Trial,4,"August 29, 2013","I've used ""kafkaesque"" as something that gets more confusing the more information you get on the subject. The Trial did not change my definition or use of ""kafkaesque"" though now I have an appreciation for Kafka having read my first Kafka novel."
The Trial,4,"November 11, 2013","Maybe I'm jaded by modern ironical media, but Kafka doesn't seem very Kafkaesque to me. He's a bit hum-drum. Then there's The Trial. This one got to me, got me so mad I was bouncing. I wanted to shout and strangle some of the characters. Great!"
The Trial,5,"November 28, 2014",A haunting descent into nightmare and a brilliant work.... Elements of finely crafted rather black humor and dark satire. Ahead of its time in cultural/political criticism. Now I can't help calling everything kafkaesque.
The Trial,4,"June 18, 2015","Remember a dream you've had in which you did stuff which makes absolutely no sense? This novel, for all intents and purposes, is a nightmare of a paranoid guy with serious issues of persecution phobia and likes. Truly a ""kafkaesque"" nightmare."
The Trial,4,"July 26, 2016","This is a sort of difficult book for me to review, because the story is so minimal. I did enjoy the strange style, which is at the same time very conventional and at times rather weird. So this being the 1st Kafka book I've read, I think I know what is meant now by ""Kafkaesque""."
The Trial,5,"February 5, 2016","One of my favourite ever. Kafkaesque may be an overused term but the book resonates. Institutions and processes bereft of reason but with their own functional internal logic reduce people to objects, not subjects. I love Kafka's style."
The Trial,5,"April 23, 2021","No one is more Kafkaesque than Kafka! And no one better captures the insanity of bureaucracy.

The Executioner s Song,5,"December 29, 2016","There is quite a backlash against romantic portrayals of murderers, particularly ones with as few redeeming qualities as Gilmore. But no matter what Dave Eggers or anyone else says, you can love this amazing book and not love Gary Gilmore. To be clear: Gilmore is the central character, with his abusive habits (most notably his repeated attempts to get Nicole to kill herself), his racism, and general psychopathy on full display. But this is also the story of 1976 America: after a decade-long death penalty moratorium (including the four years between Furman and Gregg), Gary Gilmore is what it took for a state to actually execute someone. Gilmore needed to be white (despite the protests of the NAACP that executing a white man would endanger the black folks on death row), unsympathetic, and most importantly, unique in his quest to actually be executed. Even so, Gilmore had to overcome obstacles to actually be executed. First, he had to overcome the ACLU and other anti-death penalty advocates advocating a reverse Kafkaesque nightmare where a prisoner is forced to challenge his death sentence at every turn (not to mention the Catch-22 of arguing that only an insane person would argue for their death penalty, and you can't execute the insane). Second, he had to overcome a state that kept refusing to believe that he was serious, fighting in the name of victim's families who refused to participate and keeping him from killing himself so that they could kill him later."
Watchmen,5,"October 26, 2023","Historically, store racks and newsstands at that time were blurring the lines between reality and life being printed on paper. Late 80s western paranoia brought about the advent of the on-going cold war, and heavy consumerism giving birth to the ‘tyranny of choice’. The complete paradigm shift of most modern societies, and even developing ones brought about by the late 60s and the subcultures accompanying it, have single handedly changed the cultural landscapes in them. Comic books, known for encapsulating a ‘gradual’ rather than ‘revolutionary’ shift(s), were completely adamant to the changing environment. With the release of the book, Watchmen signaled the day that the notes of what the silver age and the golden age had written, being the final blow and outright being the day the music finally died. It had become in itself, the symbolic representation of the four horsemen. Gone are the campy, trouser wearing, absurd, and colorful nature of comics, to what can only be as some Kafkaesque or Orwellian nightmare that discomforts the readers into being more aware of the reality that they live in. If comic books and the very heroes in them comfort the readers and put them into harmonious trances, Watchmen embodies the societal ills that we have been accustomed to. The book writes its narrative on what needs to be written, rather than being ignorant and turning a blind eye to the grim reality that most readers at that time were simulated in."
The Prince,4,"July 11, 2021","With these credentials in his preface to The Prince, Niccolo Machiavelli appeals to the Medicis (who were ruling Italy in the beginning of 1500s and had imprisoned him) with his political knowledge and usefulness as an advisor. The author lending his name to this popular term like Kafkaesque, what does it really mean to be ""Machiavellian""? An individual characteristic that makes someone inhumanly and pragmatic towards a goal and capitalising on opportunities towards that goal with a cunning foresightedness and self-serving manipulativeness. It's not just this political strategist's history that provides the legacy of this term, but also this very book which formally captures the author's ideologies towards the real relationship between a ruler and the subjects and maintaining power/control at all costs."
The Prince,Not rated,"June 10, 2022",Gelukkig is Kafka nog wel genoeg Kafkaesque. Ik vind het wel fijn om in taalkundige stabiliteit te leven.
The Prince,4,"April 14, 2018","Niccolò Machiavelli … the name has a seductive musicality, like all the Devil’s best tunes, and in Italian, ‘Il Principe’ uncoils like a snake, before hissing and then biting. This, his most famous work, has insinuated its way into our psyche until ‘Machiavellian’ has become part of a sinister cabal of authorial-adjectives including 'Orwellian', 'Lovecraftian' and 'Kafkaesque'.&nbsp; Yet how many people appreciate its true meaning, having read ‘The Prince’?&nbsp; Is its reputation merited?&nbsp; Is it a useful, topical read, or a dusty, centuries-old curiosity?"
The Prince,4,"August 19, 2014","The Prince, by the Machiavelli. You have to be quite the author for your name to become an adjective: Dickensian, Kafkaesque, Shakespearian all well and good, but for much of the last 400 years, Machiavelli has been regarded as the devil. And to be honest, from this book (his only work now widely known and read) it's difficult to see why."
scenes from village life,4,"July 6, 2024","The lead story, “Heirs,” is my favorite for its deadpan Kafkaesque conclusion. A pushy Jew who claims to be related to the prime occupant of a house has come down from somewhere in Russia to lay claim to co-ownership. Only one problem: the house still really belongs to the owner’s mother. Said prime occupant is irritated, infuriated, and then ultimately melts out of a kind of indifference and surrender."
scenes from village life,3,"February 7, 2013","Like a big, metaphysical mystery, a sense of unease and menace pervades throughout. Has an absurdist, Kafkaesque quality. Not sure what to make of it, to be honest."
bunny,5,"June 17, 2021","this author must have the brain of my dreams bc i aspire to write something like this one day. female-centric, dark, satirical, and incredibly kafkaesque. with an added ambiguous codependent female relationship veering into toxic territory it's giving megan abbott meets magical realism (or whatever genre this is). anyway. really enjoyed it"
bunny,3,"April 21, 2022","giving this book 3 stars feels really harsh but 4 stars feels like too much. i did enjoy it. this book is literally crazy and unlike anything ive ever read before. i spent most of it thinking it was just silly, kind of kafkaesque in how out of touch with reality it gets? this is spoilers a little bit but i think the real horror of it is how devastated and lonely and full of regret samantha is by the end of the book. i just really wasnt taking any of it seriously until sam found her way back to ava’s apartment. and then everything after that is heart wrenching and horrifying. but this book is so so creative. im still going to argue that its a little bit ridiculous but its a book about a twee girl cult at art school doing dark magic so what did i expect."
bunny,5,"January 27, 2024",Absolutely kafkaesque and brilliantly written.

The Shadow of the Wind,4,"June 30, 2013",The Shadow Of The Wind is set in Franco's Spain at the height of the fascist dictatorship although the novel does have a duel timeline by way of the main character following the novel he has adopted. What is best about the book in the atmosphere and sense of time the novel portrays. The characters seem frail and oppressed in Franco's Barcelona with an almost Kafkaesque oppression within the authorities. The book is further enhanced by the supernatural indications which swirl around the storyline. It is a fair tale of boy to man and gives a good account as a rites of passage tale.
The New York Trilogy,4,"July 30, 2017",Sterk begin en einde; het tweede verhaal was mij te Kafkaesque. Rot toch op met je mr Blue...
The New York Trilogy,5,"March 27, 2025","city of glass: honestly really good and fast paced without too much actually happening, i enjoyed that it got a bit freaky and KAfKAesque without being one of those obvious kafka ripoffs. the development towards the end was pretty predictable, but remained freaky. also i wonder if there's any meaning behind paul auster giving himself a character in the book?"
The New York Trilogy,4,"March 26, 2025","A curious book, never read a crime novel like it before. 3 books in 1, while also being 2 books in another, this might not make sense unless you read it. It’s a confusing almost kafkaesque task the main characters face in the first 2 books but it all seems to come together in the last. A book I may have to reread at some point to pick up on what I missed"
The New York Trilogy,4,"February 21, 2017","The three novels that come together to form this trilogy are so similar, yet so different and seem to grow out of each other like a natural progression. The play on the concepts of identity, authorship, creativity, obsession and sense of self are all woven together in these startling storylines that constantly have you wrinkling your eyebrows in concentration, trying to keep up with all the odd turns of events, which are sometimes quite Kafkaesque. I am still trying to disentangle the storylines in my head, but the more I do it the more I realize that they are meshed together in a literary version of Escher's Relativity, with characters moving in and out of sight at angles and trajectories that don't seem possible or explainable. While only the last story was able to make me truly feel for the character, rather than putting me in a distanced spectator's position, they all thoroughly exercised my brain and my perception of what's ""allowed"" in a novel."
The New York Trilogy,5,"December 31, 2024","The best book I read in 2024, I liked ""Ghosts"" the most but all 3 were brilliant. As others have said there is something Kafkaesque in his writing but it also reminded me of Saramago's stories. Pretty happy I discovered Paul Auster's books (better late than never) and looking forward to read more!"
The New York Trilogy,3,"December 1, 2023","It all feels fairly rewarding if you accept that you are not going to be rewarded in the traditional sense; The New York Trilogy has a rich ambiguity in a genre that usually gives you all the answers and ties a neat little bow on itself. This book was too long, it was too detailed in ways that weren't necessary, and as such wasn't hugely inspiring to read at times. And yet there is a density, a Kafkaesque surreality that I couldn't help but be drawn in by. Although I can't say I was hugely inspired by any of the plots, I am left with a unique impression, which is more than can be said for plenty of the books I've read this year."
The New York Trilogy,4,"June 18, 2020","Three novellas about writers in New York City (several named ""Paul Auster""), each superficially a detective story, each actually a kind of metaphysical journey / Kafkaesque fable / postmodern head-game / bizarro tribute to 19th-century American artists. The word, friends, is ""literary"": this is one of those notorious ""books about books about books,"" with a plot aiming straight for the navel (or asshole, if you like) and looping around again and again, over itself, all tangled-up and self-referential-like. Of course I kind of love it."
The New York Trilogy,4,"July 4, 2017","Written as three short (ish) stories, in a somewhat connected fashion, this book is dense, perplexing but ultimately rewarding. None of the three stories are entirely resolved, much is left open to interpretation and there's an almost Kafkaesque sense of bewilderment. It's quite a divisive book, if you prefer your books to clarify every last detail and wrap things up with a bow on top, you're likely to be left frustrated."
The New York Trilogy,Not rated,"February 14, 2023","The first couple of chapters, in which the identity issues of the protagonist are discussed in short, matter-of-fact sentences, felt very Kafkaesque. The research into the Tower of babel was very reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges, as is the thesis about whether a child brought up without language will speak the language of God. A doppelganger makes an early appearance."
The New York Trilogy,4,"August 3, 2024","The meticulous detailing of the main character's descent into madness and obsession in Auster's New York Trilogy is reminiscent of a Kafka short story, 'The Burrow'. The sense of inscrutable menace that permeates all three stories is undeniably Kafkaesque, adding a layer of intrigue and engagement to the narrative."
The New York Trilogy,4,"February 4, 2025","Having loved ‘4 3 2 1’, I’ve long wanted to read more of Paul Auster’s work. ‘The New York Trilogy’ combines three of his novels, all of them variations on classic detective fiction. In a series of puzzling, almost Kafkaesque narratives, Paul Auster turns the standard detective story on its head and switches up the rules of the genre: rather than develop a fast-paced, action-packed plot, he leans towards the metaphysical, posing questions of reality and identity. In the same vein, he looks at the function of language, reflecting on the limitations of words. The writing itself has a dream-like quality, with an undercurrent of menace setting the tone. It is highly atmospheric, capturing the soul of New York and transporting the reader into the city alongside Auster’s characters."
The New York Trilogy,4,"October 17, 2023","the premises are all instantly interesting and cool and then every story gets turned inside out and unravels in a series of coincidences, identity crises, kafkaesque solitude tortures. it’s pretty cool but its questionable whether any of it in the end makes sense to even auster or if he’s just trying to scratch the surface of an idea he cant get a grip on. or if he just wants to make you go uhhhhhhhhhhh. regardless pretty cool!"
The New York Trilogy,2,"July 19, 2020","I liked the first part all right, but I wasn’t motivated to finish the trilogy. This is a Kafkaesque story about an amateur detective who doesn’t know what he’s doing or why he’s investigating, or what. The second part opened with more of the same, but at least the protagonists had names in the first part. In the second part they were colors."
The New York Trilogy,4,"July 20, 2011","Comparison with other writers: obviously there is a vivid Kafkaesque feel to the book – someone is mysteriously pulling the strings, and I am strongly reminded of Haruki Murukami, particularly with the weird, unexplained occurrences – of which we are left to work out the – or invent our own – significance. Not least the double Stillman that appears at the train station (anybody got any ideas?). In terms of style I am also reminded of Raymond Carver’s ultra-dry and sparse. And of course there is homage paid to the great Raymond Chandler."
The New York Trilogy,4,"November 6, 2015","Ghosts – Wow! Another great one that I’m not even really sure what to make of (by the ending I was totally befuddled…and loving it!) The story here is that somebody named White asks a detective Blue to spy on a man named Black. What follows from here are some of the main themes from City of Glass, including this interesting fixation with calligraphy. The subtle sense of doom I felt throughout this really kept me on edge, along with the crazy Kafkaesque surrealism of it all. It’s kind of hard to describe my feelings about this but I’ll just say it’s wonderful and well worth reading."
Resurrection,3,"April 27, 2022","For Nekhlyudov, the situation is nearly Kafkaesque; he doesn’t understand why the current system must persist the way it does, whereas no one else even questions it, because they can’t imagine the world any differently. It’s not that they don’t see the flaws in the world—they quite often, and quite quickly, acknowledge the flaws—but they haven’t an ambition to imagine the world without them. Because Nekhlyudov’s knowledge is new to him, it feels as though the world has changed, or man; it’s like the Fall of Man has occurred anew, but only in his head. Similarly, though the situation seems to him Kafkaesque, to us the milieu seems to the reader mostly like that of another Tolstoy novel, despite the action being triggered by a error of bureaucracy right out of Kafka."
Resurrection,4,"October 25, 2021","At 400 and change pages this is a novella for Tolstoy. Loved the first two parts, something Kafkaesque about his descriptions of the judicial system. The third part fell off a bit for me as Tolstoy becomes almost autobiographical in his philosophy (felt the same about War and Peace). A great read that sadly mirrors the contemporary justice and prison system more than it should."
Herzog,3,"June 19, 2013","a century after the joycean interventon, may be, this mode has failed to amuse the readers so. still, the suppressed energy of the narrative as it reuses the str. of conscness technique, is hard to miss. for all its misgivings, herzog does not fail to excite. and in kafkaesque twists, the novel exposes us to the mire that love, its lack and its sudden and grotesque mutations have engendered in the modern world."
Light,4,"January 21, 2012",Kafkaesque.... Very enjoyable
gone girl,4,"August 25, 2014","I can understand why Gone Girl would be hit or miss with some readers. Anytime you're dealing with a narrative that revolves around two remarkably unlikable characters, it's going to be difficult to maintain the reader's interest. Gone Girl is also incredibly over the top, which is what I liked about it. I interpreted the novel as a crazy parody of our collective fascination with violence and spectacle. The depiction of how public opinion directs investigative efforts and the execution of justice was brutal and Kafkaesque. Some authors gravitate towards extremes and end up losing control over their narratives, but Flynn is very calculating. She uses excesses and extremes like she’s crafting a dystopian story – where some filament or pattern that exists in the zeitgeist is taken to a radical, terrifying conclusion, yet still resonates in the realm of the possible."
gone girl,4,"January 2, 2015","Wicked. With very good insight into how marriage works from the viewpoints of the two spouses. And how it also doesn't work. The author is very skilful and so much in control of the plot, pretty much more in control than Amy the heroine of the novel, is. Nick is pretty much the kafkaesque character who tries to get a grip of his life but is repeatedly thwarted. He ends up forever trapped with no way to get out."
gone girl,4,"September 12, 2013","Disconcerting, bordering on kafkaesque. Loved everything bar the ending, wich fell a bit flat. Brilliant nonetheless."
At the Mountains of Madness,3,"April 23, 2018","There's nothing quite like Lovecraft, but then again there's a lot out there that sounds like Lovecraft. So many genre conventions seem to come together in his work; science fiction, horror, adventure, steampunk, alternative history, science, pyscho-thrillers. At the Mountains of Madness has a bit of it all and, in some ways, feels a little bit like the cherry on top of his big creepy cake. It isn't as good as his petrifying short stories but it encapsulates his work both thematically and stylistically. It is a perfect fit for the adjective ""Lovecraftian"" - he is a writer whose claim to an adjective is strongest, alongside the obvious candidates like Kafkaesque or Dickensian."
my absolute darling,1,"February 15, 2018","Congratulations The Flame Alphabet, you are no longer my most-hated book ever. My Absolute Darling has taken your place. Twilight, you get to move up a notch from second to third worst book I’ve read. I disliked the book from the beginning because all it seemed to be about was guns and incest, two of my least favorite topics, but I decided I should give it a chance and possibly commend the author for tackling difficult subjects. Martin’s environmental and intellectual interests made him interesting for a very little while before it became clear that he was an absolute monster. From then on most of the book made me cringe. And it wasn’t just that Martin was revolting and Turtle’s continuing to love him were maddening (despite, I imagine, being common for such victims). The writing was just so bad. The book, especially in dialogue, was so repetitive that when I listened on Audible I kept thinking I’d accidentally hit 30-second rewind. And the characters were not believable. I liked Jacob and Brett, but they do not talk like real teenagers. As an English teacher I wish high school students used the word “Kafkaesque” and exclaimed how great George Eliot’s Middlemarch is, but it does not actually happen very often. Turtle goes off calling Jacob “a little b----” like Martin calls her and Jacob never questions her behavior. And then the worst scene at the end when the high schoolers have had a sleepover after Homecoming at Jacob’s house (even though Jacob and his parents aren’t there), and the narrator describes two naked girls (Talent clearly is obsessed with naked women because they appear a few times for no reason) and then goes on to say that Brett is playing Monopoly. No, that would not happen either. And then there’s the gratuitous use of the c-word, b-word, p-word, and every other foul word he can throw in. In dialogue I could at least excuse it as characterization of the person saying it, but the words are also thrown in constantly in narration. And then when I thought it couldn’t get worse, Cayenne (not sure of the spelling—it’s probably not like the pepper, but I listened to the book and am not sure how it was spelled, so I’m going with this since for some reason the girls put tabasco on scorpions) shows up. So now there’s kidnapping, child rape, and Turtle going along with cutting off the girl’s finger after she shoots off the tip. There was one piece of dialogue where Cayenne said Turtle’s name every other word—it would’ve been easily skimmed over reading, but in audio it was unbearable. And do we every find out why Turtle has three names? Just one more thing to bug me. When the climax finally comes it drags on forever, probably since we’ve been waiting for it to happen since the first chapter. The end with Turtle trying to feel like she has control over his life by growing the garden was ..."
We Need to Talk About Kevin,4,"December 30, 2011","The book, an epistollary, follows the one-way conversings between the mother of Kevin, Eva, and her husband Franklin. Their story is one of Kafkaesque hopelessness, in which mother, father, son and daughter are all flawed, yet tied together by the hand of fate, the result of which is the perpetual torment one another."
The Yellow Wall Paper,4,"August 19, 2017",I have to admit that I was pretty freaked out by this. In a weird way it reminded me of the house of leaves. In that there is a piece of wallpaper that is doing funky things with the protagonists mind. It’s quite Kafkaesque in that it’s the story of a bloke and his wife and there is clearly something wrong with the woman as the husband has decided to take the lady to another part of the country where she can rehabilitate herself better. You are not fully told what is wrong with her at first although you just get an eerie feeling that there is something not fully right with her. She gets put into a room which has yellow wallpaper which is a disgusting colour to have as wallpaper I believe especially the type of yellow as is described in the book. She slowly starts going mad and starts seeing things in the wallpaper which really freak her out and you out as the reader. It’s about woman subjugation and the effects that had on her psyche. It’s a very short book and it’s incredible how vividly everything is described with such scarcity of words. I really got into this book and wish it had been a bit longer hence the 4 stars. Here are my best bits:
The Yellow Wall Paper,5,"August 15, 2011","Eventually she discovers the woman behind bars within the wallpaper, which seems to confirm the earlier interpretation about the patterns of society. But at the same time it can be read as a sign that her mental illness is getting worse. A similar moment occurs – like a brief visit to the outside world – when the woman in the wallpaper shakes the front pattern. Following the allegorical reading, feminists are beginning to rattle their cages, from which they are yet unable to escape, for “the pattern - it strangles so”. The narrator decides to break the pattern and sets out to do so with great determination until, after an orgy of “but sentences” the conflict seems to take over completely. She has a severe breakdown and bites off a little piece of her bolted down bed. She appears to have lost her mind at this point – or has she lost her identity as a woman? The suffering wife and narrator has become the woman from the wallpaper – has broken out of it, and completed her Kafkaesque metamorphoses. For the woman who creeps in circles on the floor at the end of the story, despite the fact that she is creeping over her unconscious husband, can hardly be considered a liberated, emancipated human being. Instead, alienation and despair triumph and everybody, man and woman alike, loses. The patterns of the yellow wallpaper, whether they are understood literally or as symbols of society, drive this woman or women in general, into “utter mental ruin”."
The Yellow Wall Paper,4,"November 30, 2021","It seemed to me that the husband really did have his wife's best interests in mind, in prescribing her this treatment; and after all, she appeared to get better for a while. Personally I didn't read it to be a tale of oppression, preferring the more surrealist and Kafkaesque lens, though I guess the feminist interpretation makes more sense considering the author's own circumstances."
The Man Within,3,"November 20, 2021","This first novel by Graham Greene is a psychological study of personality development. Most of the story is told using interior points of view of the self-destructive young smuggler, Andrews. The title refers to various aspects of his character, e.g. self-loathing, cowardice, indecisiveness, the demands of a dead father. As the inner critic begins to take the form of a unique personal identity, Greene's story-telling style slowly transforms from Kafkaesque ambiguity to a clear dramatic form."
Contemplation,4,"October 16, 2022","A charming picture of carefree children, playing and exploring. Not at all Kafkaesque."
Contemplation,4,"July 18, 2016","This little book surprised me a lot. Before today I had only read Kafka's The Metamorphosis, and have, like many others, mostly associated him with works dealing with doom and gloom. As a result some works by other writers have been called Kafkaesque if they are ""gloomy"" enough."
Contemplation,2,"September 11, 2024","The kafkaesque themes are deeply infused throughout this debut collection of stories, including alienation, absurdity, and existential dread. As for personal taste, it left me somewhat unsatisfied – the stories were too short, the experiences too fleeting."
Contemplation,4,"October 10, 2014","I haven't read a lot of Kafka but if I understand the term Kafkaesque correctly, then this small collection of sketches are anything but. Written at an early time before he had embarked on any of his major writings, this collection of nostalgic, sometimes melancholy observations &amp; meditations are fresh, innocent &amp; richly poetic. Written with a great deal of sensitivity to detail, they can be difficult at times to read. I found my mind wandering off the page often when one of his many beautiful evocations led my mind into its own world of thoughts. One must draw one's mind back to the stories again and again. Although 'stories' would not be a fitting description for these fragments. Observations, pure writing, stream of consciousness would better describe them. Some seem to contradict themselves in their point, winding into their own narrative as the writers thoughts might. Some seem self-indulgent, but why not? This was an experimental stage in his career &amp; he had not yet found a voice to adhere to. If Kafka had stopped here &amp; merely polished this state of prose into 'Kafka', he would have been a great writer, but not the Kafka we know today. His phrasing, the way he looked at objects and their place in reality struck me over and over. If the stories themselves lacked backbone &amp; structure, they could be forgiven for the language which represented them. Anyone who loves reading, who loves beauty should not pass this little book by, even if after reading it you are left not having read Kafka."

No Exit,5,"June 11, 2017","I was thinking along the lines of a dark, surreal Kafkaesque nightmare, but it's nothing of the sort really. Here, this is much more of a quirky and light-hearted rendition of hell, Sartre's saying something that's very true to human nature, pushing this idea to its extreme, but using hell as a metaphor for the actions of the three individuals."
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,4,"May 4, 2025","Pierwsza część książki podąża standardowo-dziewiętnastowiecznym modelem pisania noweli, ale na szczęście? utwór Stevensona bierze go do góry nogami implementując Kafkaesque-owe rozwiązania zagadek, po których aż chce mi się patrzeć z niedowierzaniem."
governor of the homeless,5,"May 30, 2016","“The trial was about something else entirely,” our narrator informs us, adding, “I’m writing this [book] to see if I can figure out what that was.” Thus we are invited to come along and see if we too might figure things out. In the terse chapters that follow, we're presented with various pieces of the puzzle, including a lurid dime-store novel, part of a typewritten manuscript of a historical novel that reads more like pulp fiction, an impromptu courtroom screening of an old movie, anecdotes about the accused, a revelatory dream, and a lesson of sorts on avian evolution, all which may or may not untangle the mystery of Wilson’s Kafkaesque trial."
One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,3,"February 20, 2025","There’s this sense of fulfilment in the work done by Shukhov and the others which cannot be explained rationally. Shukhov and the 104th regiment were forced to do manual labour in the freezing winter of Russia. They had to pick ice to lay down mortar, which was getting frozen before they had even laid it. And in particular, the Soviets were not all nitty-gritty about the ‘quality’ of work being done. They did not need the prisoners to do skilled labour. They did not want the laborers to do actual, meaningful work; no, their intention was the furthest thing from it. In involving the labourers in kafkaesque labour, they could break them. They did not want the laborers to get any sense of fulfillment from the work."
One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,5,"February 16, 2023","Solzhenitsyn manages to imbue the repetitive routine, the bleakness of the camp with a touch of the Kafkaesque absurd: the endless counting of prisoners, in rows of five, in all weathers; the small triumphs such as another inmate gracing you with the end of his cigarette, and tragic defeats like having a wet foot. As we are gradually introduced to the cast of characters we discover their supposed offences: 'Gopchik had been jailed for taking milk to Ukrainian guerillas hiding in the forest.' Others 'had been lumbered with twenty-five years a piece just for being Baptists.' Many were down as spies, 'but they were just ex-prisoners of war. Shukhov was one of those.' However, although injustice might be the overarching theme, it hardly matters to Shukhov and his gang, who must, today, use all their ingenuity to restart the power plant in freezing weather."
One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,5,"August 24, 2021","when something is soul crushing i normally expect it to be a ton of bricks, that hit and leave incredible carnage in its path. I did not expect something so banal, so tedious, so mundane to be this soul crushing and exhausting. The Life of Ivan Denisovich is so absurd it is almost Kafkaesque, the truly maddening thing about it is that it isn't some exaggeration or absurdist rendition, its just the day in and day out of a people victimized by their leaders. It was a short read and it was boring, but i imagine that was the point, high points include hiding some crust of bread, and smoking a secret cigarette. This story is the story of people making due in whatever circumstances they are given, and the ways in which it eventually breaks those people down."

The Sheltering Sky,5,"July 28, 2021","This novel is a portrayal of the African cultural shock experienced by Western visitors, painted in existentialist colors. The trip taken by Port and Kit Moresby in their flight from post-WWII chaos and in hope of healing their twelve years of marriage is Bowles’s stage for the classic-flavored existentialist drama. In one of the initial, almost Kafkaesque scenes where Port immerses himself in the foreign night following a young woman who sells her body and time for money, the story she weaves for him, as if taken from the Arabian nights, prophetically forecasts Port’s path."
The House of the Spirits,4,"February 1, 2023","Allende has a talent for honing in on moments of profound, powerful introspection. I'll close by sharing the below paragraph, which took my breath away in its demonstration of this talent and in its capsuled nature. It could stand on its own, nearly Kafkaesque:"
Malone Dies,4,"July 11, 2021","The novel Malone Dies represents an evolution of the preceding Watt and Molloy. The figures of Malone and Macmann have much in common with Watt and Molloy: forlorn, passive victims of a hostile environment, stubbornly surviving. The insanely obsessive analytics of Watt and the Kafkaesque bureaucratic arrangements of Molloy have been replaced by more stripped-down, inwardly-focused, introspective writing in Malone Dies. There is humor here, but more subtly pitched than in Molloy. The novel also seems to draw nearer to an autobiographical rendering of Beckett's life and concerns. Writing the novel was evidently an incredibly draining process. According to Deidre Bair (Samuel Beckett: A Biography): ""While he was writing it, everyone close to him feared that he might literally die when it was finished. As Malone's efforts to write grew more painful and exhausting, so did Beckett's."" It is astonishing that Beckett, aged just 42, was entering so much into the character of his fictional octogenarian, bed-ridden Malone."
Under the Glacier,4,"April 2, 2014","A beautiful kafkaesque novel, that asks some important questions about life, but is at the same time a parody. It's not like anything I've read before; a unique satyric novel, beautifully written. He deserved the Nobel-prize in literature like few of the laureates did. It left me speechless, and it's a shame that so few people have read it."

The Piano Teacher,Not rated,"January 29, 2021","Unsurprisingly this violence spills over from one relationship to another  a tiny example of this that I liked was the family who had been living in Vienna for four generations who were none the less described as Polish, this violent non-acceptance of self leads to extreme non-acceptance and judgement of others as irredeemably Other, connection and close relationship are impossible. The mother assaults the daughter for buying herself a new dress - money which could have gone towards saving towards the unbuilt house  reminding me rather of the  pardon me  stupid people who blame young working people's inability to afford to buy a house on their consumption of avocado on toast rather than the steadily increasing disparity between wages and house prices  while in turn the daughter ""Im Unterricht bricht sie einen freien Willen nach dem anderen. Doch in sich fuehlt sie den heftigen Wunsch zu gehorchen."" (p.103) but there we have the danger, the daughter's inclination to listen and to have contact, this weak point is exploited by one Walter Klemmer  who on occasion becomes a Kafkaesque Walter K.  who dreams of a relationship with her, intending from the start to move on from her - in his thoughts trade up as one does with a first car moving from clapped out old banger to slightly less old old banger with slightly less bald tyres. He is a homo economicus, well schooled in Austria, attending music classes as well as his technical college because this gives him a slightly higher status out in the styx (all this again is violence, the violence of social structures) The music school is though part of the architecture of social violence - it will produce musicians only for provincial organisation or at best the radio and tv orchestra, one needs more than talent and skill to get into the most prestigious bodies in the Capital. His thoughts are of himself as a hunter in pursuit of his prey, while in her actions she is more like a bird watcher, packing a roll and (a beautiful touch) chocolate milk to go out and spy on couples making love in the open. Sexuality is for her almost something alien to be observed in others, her upbringing has distanced her from from her self."
The Lottery and Other Stories,5,"June 19, 2024","Shirley Jackson will always be one of my favourite authors. Her kafkaesque peculiar style is unmatched. I love how her stories can leave much up to the imagination with very minimal context. I can definitely see why the lottery is one of her most famous works yet, I enjoyed all of the others in this book."
The Lottery and Other Stories,4,"June 15, 2025","It's almost unfortunate that it feels the story of ""The Lottery"" overshadows all of Jackson's other stories, because she was a master at making the normal horrifying. She introduces the terrifying without there being anything that jumps out and is actually scary; it all boils down to atmosphere and just an unnerving break in reality and normality that makes her writing, still to this day, utterly fantastic. Easily my favorite story out of this whole collection was ""The Witch"", perfectly capturing her way of making the normal utterly terrifying, and ""My Life with R. H. Macy"" is surprisingly funny and Kafkaesque."
The Lottery and Other Stories,4,"July 22, 2022","If I say that many of these stories reach a ""Kafkaesque"" intensity, it is not to say that Jackson is copying Kafka. Only that she describes the trapped, nightmarish feeling with a comparable brilliance and a unique ""Jacksonesque"" quality that places these moments squarely in the center of the everyday. Only wish there was more of hers to read."
The Lottery and Other Stories,4,"December 7, 2018",The Lottery is a classic KAfkaesque story with a classic ending. It seems more relevant today more than ever. The simple horror of a twisted ending thAt reveals the whole story structure.
The Lottery and Other Stories,2,"May 17, 2010","Somewhat disappointing. 'The Lottery' itself, probably the most famous short story in American literary history, is a small masterpiece, and there are one or two other worthwhile stories in it, like the bleak Yatesian 'Elizabeth', or the drole 'The Witch'. But most of these stories to me seem rather slight, dated pieces of ladies' magazine fiction. There's little horror, and although some of the stories about children could be read as horror stories ('The Witch' is a case in point), that's only true if you want to read them that way. They just as easily fall into the category of drole 'Kids say the darndest things' anecdotes. Also, the social anxieties expressed in the other stories aren't kafkaesque enough by far to send any shivers down my spine. They seem to have more to do with the social insecurities of the growing middle class in the affluent fifties than with any existential angst."
Perfume,3,"December 21, 2022","The book is the story of Grenouille, an uncompassionate Kafkaesque homophobe with an eerie obsession for scents, for which he is ready to commit just about any type of crime. Ironically, he meets his end because of others’ empathy/love for him."
the big short,5,"July 10, 2012","Almost nobody saw the 2008 financial meltdown coming. But a few visionary individuals not only saw it coming, but made hundreds of millions by betting against the subprime market that would destroy the economy. In the ""Big Short"", Lewis profiles the origins of the 2008 economic crash by chronicling the men who saw an impending disaster, and tried to make money off of it. This volume is very easy to read, and seems more like a story than nonfiction. Filled with larger than life characters, drama, and a Kafkaesque Wall Street, ""The Big Short"" is a good read that is bound to astonish and shock."
Cloud Atlas,4,"February 25, 2016","Also, another cool thing: each part of the story is written in a different style. Adam Ewing is writing a travel journal, and Frobisher's writing to his... idk, boyfriend, Sixsmith. Luisa Rey's is a thriller/mystery/suspense, Cavendish is a Kafkaesque story (and hey, I found a new and fun trigger reading this-- JOY), Sonmi is a really cool Brave New World but better story, and Zachry is a post-apocalyptic thing. Plus, the language changes, moving from Adam Ewing's 18th-century prose to Zachry's future slang."
Cloud Atlas,3,"November 1, 2012","I don't get too into hard-boiled crime fiction, or dystopian science fiction, or plot-driven narratives about Kafkaesque false imprisonment, so I wasn't much into four of the six stories. I honestly wasn't invested in the 19th century story either, at first, but it grew on me toward the end. My favorite, by far, was the story of the composer set in 1930s Belgium. The narrator was an amazing character, as was the crochety old guy, and the detailed workings of a musical mind in composition rang utterly true for me. That story could've (should've?) been a whole book by itself."
Cloud Atlas,4,"October 20, 2012","The characters are flawed, even those high minded in their efforts to achieve their goals. Age old prejudices persist into the future. The Cloud Atlas feels more like a series of novels linked together, or perhaps, a series of connected short stories with a definite Kafkaesque feeling of helplessness to effect an eventual meaningful change."
Cloud Atlas,5,"January 29, 2021","What it does, however, is tell an utterly compelling, smart and enjoyable story – or rather, six thereof – in the way the best short story collections do. There are subtle parallels and themes running through the narrative of a lawyer traveling the colonial South Pacific, a goatherd in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, a composer out of his luck in the 1930s, a clone waitress in a corporate dystopia, a journalist taking on an energy corporation and a publisher getting imprisoned in a care home/kafkaesque nightmare for the elderly, in quite beautiful ways. All these stories have to do with cyclical liberation and subjugation of humans by humans, with how everything we do has consequences but none of them is final, how the will to do good, kindness, mercy and art will prevail in some shape or other, and how they connect us across ages, genres and vastly different kinds of perils."
Cloud Atlas,5,"September 14, 2014","Those two were the most original. The others felt more like Mitchell was playing with the conventions of different genres, although as they continued, they came into their own and became enjoyable stories in their own right, rather than simply experiments. With The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, at one point it became pretty kafkaesque (think The Trial), and I thought I really, really didn't want to read this. But then the focus moved from the horribly frustrating situation to being a sort of picaresque escape caper, and I adored it."
Cloud Atlas,4,"January 20, 2012","The NY Times reviewer states, ""Mitchell is clearly a genius. He writes as though at the helm of a perpetual dream machine..."" But I'd say his writing is not the surreal dreamlike writing of, say Haruki Murakami, or the Kafkaesque meanderings of Kazuo Ishiguro in The Unconsoled. His stories have more solidity, more philosophical musings, more action. So what is this book about? How are these stories connected? It is about refusing to accept slavery for oneself or others. It is about one generation's actions affecting the next generations. But it's also just a very good read, although certainly not an ""easy"" read."
Cloud Atlas,5,"January 12, 2017","This strength is also a potential drawback. We jump from dense historical fiction filled with arcane terminology, to a thriller, to a Kafkaesque satire, to a SF dystopia. I would happily read any of those books, and am happy to read them threaded together, but I can also understand why readers might be turned off. Some characters and voices are more engaging than others (Adam Ewing sailing around the Pacific did not do much for this writer, I must confess), and they are all limited in how far they can grow because each protagonist only has ninety pages to stretch his or her wings. So if you like novels with deep, expansive character work, you will be short-changed here."
Cloud Atlas,5,"March 2, 2014","There are six different stories here, each seperated by decades or even centuries, but all intertwined. Each one is written in such a completely different voice and style that, examined individually and out of context, you would never imagine they were written by the same person. A ship passenger crossing the Pacific in the mid 19th Century, a would-be composer in 1931 Bruges, an investigative reporter in the 1970s, an elderly publisher in the present day lost in a Kafkaesque nightmare, a deeply appalling sleek techno dystopia centuries hence, and an even further distant post-apocalypse with the most delightful invented ""slanguage"" since the one Burgess created for ""A Clockwork Orange""."
Three Men in a Boat,5,"December 21, 2020","Still funny 131 years after it was first published. There's not many books you can say that about and, as such, Three Men in a Boat requires no further review (but good to know that a favourite book of my childhood and youth still retains all its charm and humour when I revisited to alleviate some of the cloying, Kafkaesque gloom of repeated lockdowns)."
Secret Rendezvous,3,"May 16, 2023","I previously enjoyed both Kobo Abe's The Woman in the Dunes [1962] and The Face of Another [1964], and I thought Secret Rendezvous was the weakest of the three. The premise here is still delightfully surrealist, absurd and intriguing: a husband wakes up to find his wife missing - she was unnecessarily taken as a patient from her home to a hospital. The husband starts to search for his missing wife and finds the world growing stranger as his search deepens. Secret Rendezvous is an extension of Kafkaesque nightmare filled with strange erotic instances and human experimentations (not to mention a person there who thinks he is a horse!). The problem with Secret Rendezvous is that the readers of today are no longer as perplexed and fascinated by mass video surveillance and even strange erotic practices as they undoubtedly were when Abe first wrote his book."
Secret Rendezvous,2,"September 28, 2018","This Kafkaesque tale of a former model-turned-salesman searching for his missing wife at a hospital to which she may or may not have been transported by an unexpected ambulance has all the makings of something I'd like: satirical commentary on bureaucracy, subversive use of sexual imagery, a story-within-a-story structure. And yet, it never came together for me. I can see Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton making this into a strangely beautiful movie but as a piece of literature, it simply never gels."
Secret Rendezvous,3,"July 21, 2016","*waiting in the dmv, its taking a while* ""Hmm. How...kafkaesque."""
Secret Rendezvous,4,"February 2, 2014","more identity fun, with out-and-out absurdist and erotic streaks and a nicely kafkaesque sense of the unknowable, unconquerable institution"
Secret Rendezvous,4,"March 23, 2025","My thoughts will naturally develop and change over time and on subsequent reading, for now though, another enigmatic work by one of the prodigious writers of the 'kafkaesque' hits its mark."
Secret Rendezvous,5,"February 24, 2025","People throw around the term ""Kafkaesque,"" but this delivers. More obscene and grotesque than Kafta, for sure, and not for everybody for that reason. Probably my favorite book of the year during the year that I read it (maybe around 2010?). The ambulance arriving to take away the main characters perfectly fine wife, and the acquiescence to this, sets the tone."
Secret Rendezvous,4,"January 25, 2015","Inexplicably, the man just lets her go, and then goes off in not very urgent search of her when she does not return, encountering Kafkaesque (or perhaps Abesque) obstacles at every step."

Letters to Milena,2,"January 19, 2024","He fell in love with her because she merely understood him, which is something he's always yearned for. Knowing his complex personality, I'm not surprised how their story went. The very prominent commitment issues and the emotional outbursts that alternated with hesitancy bothered me during reading.

Letters to Milena,4,"August 22, 2024","""Cartas a Milena"" is, in my opinion, the perfect reflection of Kafkaesque writing, even more than his other works. Kafka wrote with no limitations, similar to an internal monologue, which showcases the intimacy of the epistolar relationship they had. Throughout the letters, the reader feels like it is having a conversation with Kafka himself. Unfortunately, Milena's letters were lost, as she asked their mutual friend, Max Brod, to get rid of them. One can only imagine how impactful the complete epistolary exchange might have been."
Letters to Milena,4,"February 19, 2023","Franz Kafka was born in Prague, a Czech novelist, and a short story writer; widely known as one of the major personalities of 20th-century literature. To distinguish his absurd and distinct writing style scholars have created the adjective ‘Kafkaesque’. He quoted, “the whole human race was the product of one of God’s bad days.”"
Letters to Milena,5,"August 3, 2020","Since Kafka’s books are pretty-dark, exposing the dark inhumane sides of human being, his Kafkaesque, I was amazed to see a tenderer, loving side of his personality, and surprisingly to be inside his mind. I felt more drawn in by his words. They touch you right in the heart, just like a sharp diabetic testing needle which pierces your skin and causes a sharp and a burning and a tinging pain that lasts for a second but leaves an echo and stir the waves inside of you, if waves do exist inside of us, or the heebie-jeebies or the butterflies in the belly."
Letters to Milena,4,"December 29, 2021","What I found quite interesting is that Kafka's writing style is famously described as Kafkaesque, however Kafka's close friend Max Brod said he hated this term, as Kafka's closest friend he believed this term doesn't suit Kafka at all."
Letters to Milena,3,"January 12, 2022","And I love the Milena part in appendix. After all those passionate and wondrous of Kafkaesque letters, I find the clarity in Milena.

He meant what he said, he really felt, yet it was one of the most beautiful things I have ever read in my life. Kafka is a very interesting person, intellectual, and very fun when he talks about his dreams, his feelings, about Doestoevsky, and the books he's reading, but also very dramatic too (kafkaesque)."
Pictures from an Institution,2,"June 14, 2019","Gertrude and Rosenbaum dominate the book, the other less prominent characters are Benton’s president, professors and spouses and, in a few cases, the children of these. We meet one student by name and are told briefly about a Kafkaesque story she has written – this is far too thin a reed to bear any interpretation that sees in it a general condemnation of Benton’s educational practices."

A woman leaves her house to go for a walk, and when she returns, she finds strangers have moved in. These strangers are adamant that they rightly live there. We follow the woman as she tries to seek help from the police to take possession of her house back. I would have given this one 5 stars, only I found it a bit long."
Solaris,4,"September 28, 2024","Review: Solaris, by Stanisław Lem, I’m still swimming through the depths of this psychological and Kafkaesque existential piece. This book is a journey into the alien, the unknown, and the unresolved, a what's considered hard science fiction, where the themes of science, history of science, and meta analysis of science, is explored. Solaris camouflaged itself as a classical science fiction, but what lays underneath is layers among layers of how we operate in our own minds."
pure colour,4,"March 24, 2022","how open-minded are you willing to be? this book requires a lot of flexibility. i tend to dislike some of its key elements, such as god-related explanations of the world, and Kafkaesque transformations, but they didn't ruin the book for me. somehow, i've enjoyed it. Heti's tender writing manner is exactly what i wanted and needed these days. so, it's a yes for me!"
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,5,"October 13, 2021","Modern readers now regard Jackson as a central figure of the America Gothic as much of her fiction paints a fascinating—if not disturbing—portrait of postwar America . Yet, I find it difficult to pigeonhole Jackson as a Horror writer. While her narratives do tend to focus on emotionally disturbed women, they also present us with rather Kafkaesque realities. Time and again Jackson magnifies the way in which traditions and societal expectations pose a threat to one's individuality and creativity. Indeed, most of her stories follow a woman's 'quest' to find or maintain her identify."
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,5,"October 7, 2021","Or maybe Constance is less a hostage and more a jailer, one who in a Kafkaesque trap of circumstances, is confined to the kitchen, ever on diligent patrol against inmate interference."
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,4,"May 9, 2011","While the story defies description, I can say that Jackson's greatest strengths are her ability to create and maintain a certain mood and her ability to set the perfect pace for her story. I really think that ""Jacksonian"" is the only word that can be used to describe the mood/world/tone of the book in the same way that Kafka's stories can only be described as ""Kafkaesque."""
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,4,"May 12, 2022","I like to begin my reviews with a memorable quote from the book, but Jackson’s prose was so consumable, clear, quick, that I did not take note of any passages while reading. It reminded me of a Stephen King novel, but actually nuanced and interesting; this story is scary, horrifying, even. It is also simultaneously magical and mundane. I always look for something strange or new in the writing style and this was neither, so for that reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5, but this is a really great book. I related to a lot of the emotions and characters, and it just felt correct somehow. It is a somewhat Kafkaesque story, but with an actual exciting plot. I’m taking away a feeling of stasis from this book."
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,5,"November 13, 2022",5 out of five - a brilliantly unhinged mixture of psychological horror and kafkaesque black comedy.
We Have Always Lived in the Castle,2,"June 17, 2014","A claustrophobic, Kafkaesque tale without air, or lightness, or much in the way of sympathetic characters. The central mystery is revealed in one line nearly at the end, and it provides no relief. It is well-writen, but also like being buried alive."
high rise,4,"September 7, 2016","It's strange when you think about it that English writing should have contributed a certain kind of adjectival author to literature. Obviously you can make a meaningful adjective out of any famous writer's name, but the type of author I have in mind is more specific, one who usually 1. is devoted to the shorter forms; 2. has a ferociously coherent and singular set of settings, characters, and stories; 3. writes in an identifiable signature style, often characterized by a deceptively dry mimicry of essayism; 4. eschews realism of content and deep psychological characterization in favor of fantasy, allegory, or philosophy; and 5. tends to communicate a pessimistic or nihilistic metaphysic, often with a despairing quietist anti-politics: Kafkaesque, Lovecraftian, Borgesian, Sebaldian."
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,4,"March 7, 2024","so kafkaesque, if kafka was a middle-english speaking Welsh guy who like knights and whatnot. They both have castles??"
The Road,5,"July 28, 2014","I absolutely loved this book. Wow. It is an existentialistic tale about a boy and his father who trek cross country in post apocalyptic US. It's also a story about the unconditional love of a father who wants nothing more than to see his son survive in a kill or be killed world. The antagonists are marauders who live of other people's hard work, and, well, they actually live off other people when food can't be found. I read it in less than one day. I will be sure to read it again, so I can concentrate on more of the existentialistic encounters. Highly recommended if you're interested in Kafkaesque type novel. Cheers!"

The Stranger,4,"February 10, 2019","I don't know what to write here. Absurdity, existentialism, atheism, kafkaesque, outsider, flock - i wrote everything and then i erased it. Because I really don't know. Just today I told a friend - ""I don't know"" is not a good answer, you should always have an answer parat. And look what I am doing now."
The Stranger,4,"April 14, 2022","A book that raises many more questions than it answers, ‘The Stranger’, whets the appetite and leaves you feeling… existential? contemplative? might I even say kafkaesque?"
The Stranger,4,"November 19, 2024","Dry, kafkaesque, nihilistic, and, at times, comedic -I thorougly enjoyed l'étranger! Weirdly uplifting ending!!!"
The Stranger,5,"October 15, 2024","At a point this book was quite kafkaesque , especially towards the part when trial took place ! I was sceptical as to where this was going ."
The Stranger,4,"November 12, 2022","After that I started getting a kafkaesque vibe from the book, because of all the absurd things going on, but isn't life absurd, after all? In the end, though, the last 25 pages made it all worth it."
The Stranger,5,"September 1, 2019","When I was through the Part One, I thought it to resemble Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment: here was the part of Crime, and now we stepped onto the Punishment. Not that it was. Close to the end, it flowed into Kafkaesque mood with its absurdity and protagonist alienation. Matthew Ward’s use of words is just beyond amazing: the gentle indifference of the world, the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, to give a condemned man a chance, etc. - so many words I noted down for myself. My heart ached for M’s final speech when I finally heard him: he stayed too silent throughout the novel. The world didn’t really matter to him. He didn’t really matter to the world he was in."
The Stranger,5,"October 12, 2018",A little bit of Kafkaesque - an endlessly absurd world - The Stranger by Albert Camus.
The Stranger,Not rated,"January 9, 2024","In the sixth chapter, the stranger does something different and shocking - a crime - but seemingly for no reason. This leads into part 2, where he is put through a somewhat Kafkaesque trial and asked questions which seem irrelevant to him. He describes this ordeal as going through the 'machinery of justice'."
The Stranger,4,"January 13, 2025","He never explains the reasoning behind his actions, even when he’s in front of a judge asked to speak on why he murdered a man he says “because of the sun” (like girl at least try to be kept out of prison T-T) anyways I liked it a lot. I liked the mix of existentialism and absurdism i felt that it brought a sort of kafkaesque vibe to the story. Also hope Salomon never found his dog because hello wtf???"
The Stranger,5,"May 27, 2024",camus is brilliant! his thoughts on existentialism (and absurdism) shine in this story &amp; his humorous writing is an added bonus. mersault may be the most autism-coded fictional character i’ve ever read… he’s great… and his trial is just so kafkaesque. (I do wish the english title was the foreigner or the alien instead tho)
The Stranger,4,"January 4, 2023","The difficult thing about Meursault is we're never really given a true origin to his patent existentialist nature but rather, pick up and analyze his life during one of the most tragic moments of his life which already imbalances the scales. This judgement becomes almost literal as the reader participates in a Kafkaesque trial in which Meursault becomes guilty of....not caring about his mother?! ""Ridiculous"" you think while reading it until you realize that you've been judging him for the very same thing since the infamous first line. Internally thinking to yourself that this man is ""weird"" and unsympathetic. Shame on you."
The Stranger,5,"January 17, 2024","gripping. i sat down at page 25 with the intention of reading a chapter and i finished it in the same sitting, which is a good thing. its kafkaesque for sure but the protagonist is guilty (unlike the trial). we know what he’s being tried for. he did kill the man. this seems to be more of a meditation on indifference and how somebody who has no independent desires or thoughts can get pushed into a terrible future. he is a bit of a psychopath though. very good"
The Stranger,4,"October 27, 2018","Profound, quotable, and thought provoking. Almost Kafkaesque. Existentialism: the novel."
The Stranger,5,"October 16, 2020","The trial that follows is, in a sense, Kafkaesque, and then at times in direct contradiction with it. Meursault is rendered voiceless, often literally by his own lawyer, in the courtroom; trapped by people who decide his fate for him. However, Meursault's silencing of himself deliberately and complete indifference to the proceedings leaves one without any sympathy for him. In contrast to Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, the cunning Nietzschean Superman facing inner turmoil, who eventually crumbles under the agony of his crime, Meursault simply feels nothing. He has seemingly internalised nihilism, and does not even flinch at the evil deed that he has committed."
The Stranger,5,"June 25, 2014","Very, very interesting novel/novella. Quite Dostoevskian and Kafkaesque with a little sprinkle of Richard Wright. I have to admit, the first ~30 pages were very slow; surprising considering how short this work is, but the narrative picks up quickly soon after. Camus's Meursault is somewhat similar to Dostoevsky's Underground Man in his detachment from society and inability to overcome the idle constancy in his life due to inertia. However, whereas the Underground Man tries to overcome this inertia but repeatedly fails due to his cowardly nature, Meursault seems perfectly content with his meaningless life. Meursault had opportunities (most notably when his boss offers to set him up in Paris a day before he commits the murder) to alter his direction of life, but merely gives a shrug of indifference with a tone of ""meh"" to change. Meursault also seems to adhere to some of the philosophies of the Naturalists. For one, he seems to live a life overshadowed by Determinism as he is resigned to his fate even when sentenced to the guillotine and does not try to forcibly change his situation. Secondly, he is incredibly animalistic as he seems content to only fulfill his physical needs - those of the carnal and gluttonous variety, while completely neglecting any spiritual or emotional satisfaction. Some of the secondary tangents of the novel were a joy to read as well, in particular the story of the old man Salamano and his red-scabbed dog. Whereas disturbing protagonists of other novels were lustful, violent, disillusioned or narcissistic, it is perhaps Meursault's complete indifference that is most frightening. But that doesn't mean anything."
The Stranger,4,"February 18, 2025","a great sense of weirdness happening, but not in the kafkaesque bureaucratic way, it’s more in your face. That last scene is gorgeously devised, as well."
The Stranger,Not rated,"August 18, 2022","Neither Meursault nor the world around him make any sense. Meursault is enigmatically blasé about the events around him. He is unmoved by his mother's death and doesn't seem to experience any real romantic feeling towards his fiancee. But the world is just as hostile and indifferent—his boss is annoyed that Meursault is taking time off to go to his mother's funeral; his neighbor Salamano petulantly berates his dog ""because he's always there""; his friend Raymond violently beats his girlfriend because he thinks she is having an affair; the magistrate seems more perplexed about Meursault's atheism than his act of homicide; and the whole Kafkaesque trial redounds on why Meursault did not cry at his mother's funeral rather than on his motives for murder. He seems to be accused of matricide rather than of a racially targeted murder. Everything seems absurd. No one has sensible motivations."
The Stranger,4,"January 22, 2025","Albert Camus’s The Stranger is a compelling exploration of existentialism and the absurd. Though its first half meanders with seemingly aimless events, it mirrors the protagonist’s detachment and the novel’s broader philosophical themes. With a Kafkaesque trial and a thought-provoking conclusion, it challenges readers to confront life’s lack of inherent meaning."
The Stranger,4,"September 19, 2024","Meursault is a passive protagonist, much like many of Kafka’s characters, almost indifferent and mundane, stoic in the face of absurdity. He finds fleeting joys in smoking and moments with Marie or Raymond. Even when his mother dies, he’s indifferent. He feels the change pass over him in one brief assault. Then it is gone, and his life remains the same. Meursault is an absurd and Kafkaesque protagonist in this way. He’s so physical. He is often distracted by bright lights or fatigue, so much so that he forgets what he is doing in an effort to escape the discomfort. He’s like a cockroach exposed to light. However, he is remarkably good at adjusting to change. The immediate is what affects him in a passionate surge."
The Stranger,5,"September 23, 2017","Camus likes to be ambiguous in his fiction but a familiar and reoccurring theme in many of his books is the subject of the absolute absurdity of the world that we all live in and a person’s quest for meaning and purpose within this worldview. He asks many age old questions. Is there an overall purpose to our lives? Can one make sense of the insensible? If the world is chaotic and without reason aren’t we just a reflection of this ourselves or can the individual overcome this and find their own truth? Many of his characters don’t bother themselves with these but by example illustrate them. However, once any of these are faced with imminent death they often seem to suddenly find this elusive purpose without much effort and this particular book is no exception. Only, the manner in which this comes about is rather bizarre and surreal that borders upon the Kafkaesque."
The Stranger,4,"February 10, 2025","My thoughts on this book aren't really fully formed yet. It was a very engaging experience, and I can't wait to break into more of the Camus on my shelf--there's this peculiar beauty in the simple, candid way he phrases things in this book--but I think I'll need to think for a while to really get into the depths of what it's all about. The symbolism and in particular the statements about Meursault and his feeling of mortality in the face of prosecution, particularly with his utter indifference with everything else...it was all so striking. The entire court sequence felt kafkaesque, in this brilliantly oppressive manner, spoken of only in bits and pieces of detail not even directly related to the feeling of oppression surrounding it."
The Stranger,5,"July 6, 2025","Told from the perspective of a man indifferent to the world and its arbitrary events, the story follows him as he is suddenly pulled out of detachment and made to face the consequences of a world he had no interest in. Albert Camus captures the indifference, lethargy, and resigned attitude that comes from a life devoid of meaning. And goes onto challenge these in an almost kafkaesque episode that pushes this detached philosophy to the limit until what emerges isn’t despair, but an exuberant defiance of life itself"
The Stranger,4,"March 21, 2021","Camus tells us the story of a Kafkaesque destiny. A man goes to his mother's funeral and then he has sex with a friend. Then his neighbor includes him in a fight, from which he gets to kill someone and go to trial. The prosecutor uses the argument that he had sex with a girl immediately after his mother's funeral to prove that he is a soulless person and get a life imprisonment. The story ends with him shouting violently at the priest who tries to convince him to repent and believe in divinity for his sins to be forgiven. Obviously the man was not a believer. For me, this story is very similar with The Process of Kafka"
The Stranger,5,"March 15, 2024","I started to be interested in French literature, even though I don't study it in college. Camus' philosophy (which I'm getting a hold of) is beautifully translated into the life of a man and the absurd adventures he gets himself into just because he can. Some can see the protagonist as careless but he isn't really. After all, he put his mother in a retirement home because he did care about her. The trial scenes were the best because they were nonsensical (not kafkaesque but close enough imo). Overall, I'm glad I finally finished this book. I loved it."
The Stranger,4,"March 11, 2024","Camus was inspired by Dostoyevsky and Kafka and you can really see that in this piece of work. It combined crime and self, as well as accountability and understanding. The main character thinks in a rather Kafkaesque manner, which invites the reader to decipher motivations and question what they understand about the story. The one thing is that I find the ending to be lacklustre. There’s no real closure and I wish that there was. It’s definitely an evocative piece."
The Stranger,3,"April 13, 2024","Very plain language reminiscent of Hemingway and bukowski, but the story had a gothic bleakness that I wasn’t really into. It’s a novella in length so not much depth is to be expected, serving more as a parable. I enjoyed that his lack of emotion at his mother’s funeral was used against in court for his murder trial, and the story had a kafkaesque feeling that the main character was born guilty and luckless. Overall, not very stimulating or eloquent"
The Stranger,3,"May 10, 2017",Recommended to those interested in existentialism and the Kafkaesque.
The Stranger,5,"April 23, 2020","The beauty is in the monotonous life-like details and the detachment of the protagonist, Meursault. The soliloquy of Meursault where he is being convicted brings in the Kafkaesque flavor and has me desiring for more!"
The Stranger,4,"August 7, 2019","Very kafkaesque, one of Camus's best works!"
The Stranger,4,"December 28, 2021","I'm so confused, but this is Kafkaesque done better than Kafka."
The Stranger,3,"January 3, 2022","I had difficulty making sense of this protagonist, who lacked any empathy, or having any sympathy for how his irrational choices landed him in a Kafkaesque spiral to his destruction."
The Stranger,5,"April 26, 2023",ależ kafkaesque;pp
The Stranger,4,"July 20, 2023",a bit Kafkaesque…. short but still a bit of a heavy read
The Stranger,2,"April 2, 2025","Confusing, kafkaesque book."
The Stranger,4,"April 7, 2025",very kafkaesque
The Stranger,2,"November 17, 2024",After this it felt kafkaesque with a bizarre trial which focused less on the crime and more on the character. I am not too sure how to feel and i should read it again.
The Stranger,3,"October 17, 2014","In terms of the plot, my friend Ivo wrote a review in which he pointed out how the active quality of the murder and the ennui of the protagonist seemed to be at odds. I shared this confusion. I also thought the nature of the trial, which seemed almost Kafkaesque, was a little forced. I don’t think anyone would contend that the focus of the prosecutor and jury on the mother’s funeral is an example of the social contract’s working (unless – as might be the case – this scene would have been taken differently around the time when the book was published). It seems like a breakdown of the justice system. Wouldn’t it make for a more potent commentary if Camus had used a plot device that would have reached a similar conclusion (i.e. placing the protagonist’s life in danger due to his inability to ‘play the game’) through more socially acceptable means?"
The Stranger,4,"December 7, 2024","In this monument of French literature, Camus offers us, with exquisite delicacy, the portrait of a man whose psychological depth rivals that of a Mediterranean puddle during a drought. Meursault, our Kafkaesque anti-hero, elevates the art of laconicism to a cardinal virtue, transforming emotional detachment into a form of modern heroism."
The Stranger,3,"April 25, 2015","The irony, then, is that he commits the most violent crime of passion. Murder. An act more non-sequitor, and most redolent of Kafkaesque surrealism. He is stripped further of the little humanity he has - all those little significant freedoms: the right to smoke, to kiss, to live as he will - till little more than a tincture of himself remains: only the abstract notion of he, Meausalt. The trial happens, but really just bypasses him. All the good that he's ever gone, the good friend he'd tried to be, the conscious citizen: all this counts for nought."
The Stranger,5,"November 28, 2016","Society of course feels the urge to eliminate such an individual from its existence , and feels threatened by him and by his ideas , and in his trial he is condemned - in a Kafkaesque manner- only due to the fact that he did not show enough sorrow and sadness in his mom's funeral , and that was enough to prove his guilt , and execution by the guillotine was his sentence ."
The Stranger,4,"March 1, 2020","for some reason, I was more bothered by the way the judicial system worked and how personal matters were utilised to sway the jury (but this is all probably because I read the book while listening to the secret barrister). anyways I feel that this was a good introduction for me to the existentialist thought; as I had been interested in the drama that existed Camus, Sartre and Beauvoir. the character was written well, and for some reason understandable. the indifference that the character goes through feels very relevant today, and the process Meursault goes through towards the end of the book gives me a slight kafkaesque vibe. I think I enjoyed the book for its story and exposure, not really for the philosophy, but that may be because I don't really understand existentialism just yet. next up, the plague."
The Stranger,2,"January 27, 2019","I'm sure it's a very clever book, modernist, absurdist, Kafkaesque etc. Subject, alienation. My response has been to become alienated, I can't be bothered with the protagonist, his suroundings or his life."
The Stranger,5,"April 3, 2022","An incredible study of a man's struggle with a situation he rapidly loses control over. A kind of Kafkaesque story of a seemingly ordinary man, Mersault, who in fact is anything but ordinary. Because he doesn't react to situations in the manner that society requires, he is judged as being inhuman and deserving of death when an altercation gets out of control. A moving portrayal of a man simply trying to live his life peacefully but finding himself a victim of his own actions and emotions."
The Stranger,3,"March 24, 2025","i love any book about absurdism and the kafkaesque but i wouldn't say i 'love' this book. it's cool, it makes you think sometimes. other times i was just like damn, poor guy. if i read this at 86 it'd probably be more poignant."
The Stranger,3,"May 14, 2016","A kafkaesque account of one man's experience and tragedy, reflective of his apathy with life."
The Stranger,5,"January 13, 2015","One of those books that haunts you for long after you read it, The Stranger paints an almost kafkaesque picture of a disturbed human mind."
Alice in Wonderland,2,"January 7, 2023",The nonsensical-ness and level of frustration this book left me with had an almost kafkaesque quality to it.
investigations of a dog,5,"September 11, 2018","One of the most relevant books I've read in a long time, reminds me of Tolstoy's struggles with science and truth. But really weird, (... Kafkaesque?)."
investigations of a dog,3,"September 11, 2023","A quick read, though to the core kafkaesque, I find parallels to Orwells Animal Farm („walking on their hind legs“) or even his Metamorphosis (change of taste/appetite and delusional sensations (Leukemia?)) which are embedded in several metaphors, analogies, dichotomies and of course - long sentences ;)."
investigations of a dog,3,"April 4, 2022","It did not leave me ""Kafkaesque"" like his other work but on the whole I liked for what it is."
investigations of a dog,3,"July 12, 2022","Quite an interesting thought experiment but not really enough space to explore any of them thoroughly. Everything i enjoyed was only touched on. Everything i didnt enjoy i dont feel translated into how dogs spend their days in 2022. Some sections in this book did not make sense to me despite several reading and i'm left wondering what the original intent was. But does ask some great questions on why we believe what we believe, i wouldnt describe it as an exemplary demonstration of the kafkaesque though."
investigations of a dog,4,"April 17, 2025",A bit excessive in density and heavy on the kafkaesque wording and imagery. Somewhat like the burrow but I thought the placing of ‘dog’ as an entity of its own outside of race or interior separation was an interesting approach for a take so clearly rooted in alienation and deviation from societal standards.
investigations of a dog,3,"December 29, 2020","Bu kitabı Kafka'nın yazdığına emin miyiz? İyi ya da kötü demiyorum ama hiç ""kafkaesque"" değil, bu his yüzünden okuduğuma odaklanamadım. Kitaptaki ""Akbaba"" hikayesini aslında Saki yazmış olabilir mesela..."
The Judgement and In the Penal Colony,5,"July 18, 2025","It is tempting to try and take a lighter look at the works of Franz Kafka, maybe because the atmosphere is so gloomy, tragedy is otherwise in the air, and as a ‘defense mechanism’, instead of accepting what is inevitable, in this context, nothing good can be conceived, and even then, if we have a character prosperous, somewhat cheerful, advancing in his career, finding a good companion, that is the exception that confirms the rule, it also serves as a contrast, it is all Kafkaesque, so what good does a bit of merriment…"
The Judgement and In the Penal Colony,3,"June 9, 2025",In the Penal Colony dredges up another traditionally Kafkaesque situation.
The Judgement and In the Penal Colony,5,"November 11, 2012","I am not to tell the quality, the texture of his writings, it was what you call eccentric or maybe not, because this is what you call Kafkaesque. Written in one sitting this is one of his best short stories playing with the relations of a son and father through a person who is son's friend. Oh, started talking of the story but that's what you do when you are awed--you do eccentric things."
The Judgement and In the Penal Colony,4,"November 26, 2012","I think I can finally say that I understand now what ""Kafkaesque"" means after reading this book."
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe,5,"July 10, 2025",edit: kafkaesque but sillier
bliss montage,3,"February 24, 2023","So it is that ""Bliss Montage"" feels Kafkaesque in two ways:"
bliss montage,4,"May 19, 2023","some of the stories resonated more strongly (e.g., ""returning"" and ""peking duck"") than others (e.g., the ""los angeles"" / ""oranges diptych) but wow reading this collection has pedestaled ling ma as one of the few living writers whose work i would like to follow. i like the kafkaesque, speculative premises that underpin her stories – taking a drug to disappear, living with 100 ex-boyfriends, oh and fucking a yeti – and how she builds puzzle boxes of meaning out of relatively simple prose."

bliss montage,3,"August 3, 2022","Some stories were heartbreaking (""Oranges""), some unsettling, and there was even a story that I found humorous (""Yeti Lovemaking""), but all of them left me thinking about them long after I closed the book. “Bliss Montage” shows a Kafkaesque world. And a fascinating one."
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,4,"February 11, 2025","I now officially have earned the authority to shamelessly call things ""Joycean."" Last fall I read a singular Dickens short story, so I can also say ""Dickensian"" -- now I just need to read a few sentences of Kafka and Proust and I can also use ""Kafkaesque"" and ""Proustian""😎 Prepare to be sick of me!"
Play It As It Lays,4,"January 20, 2024",I found it hard to put this book down. You become so emotionally invested in the main character and it is so beautifully written. It felt like I was reading kafkaesque female fiction. It reminded me of the woman destroyed by Simone de Beauvoir.
Collected Fictions,Not rated,"January 22, 2014","Your mission, should you find that you have already accepted it is to read Borges and to tell others the Good Word and to perhaps become as familiar with the cliché Borgesian as you are with the cliché Kafkaesque."
Collected Fictions,5,"February 8, 2025","I'm reading through the great short story writers, started with Isaac Babel, then Kafka, and now Borges. So far they exceed and confound common opinion so strangely and beautifully. Kafka is much more and other than kafkaesque, and a Borges story similarly cannot be generalized as concentric philosophical fantasies, with a chain of narrators who deliver the story, relay race like, to the reader (for instance, narrator 1 tells us about a book he read, in which narrator 2 is a character, who describes an encounter with narrator 3, and so on)."
Biedermann und die Brandstifter,4,"December 7, 2022","A somewhat Kafkaesque entertainment featuring Biedermann und Frau and the two Brandtstifter, Willi and Sepp. Willing suspension of disbelief anyone?"
Good Omens,5,"July 1, 2025","There’s a lot of subtext in this book unsurprisingly, but my favorite bit of it is the repeated references to Heaven and Hell as bureaucracies. They’re both in the business—as it were—of human souls, and in this regard they’re structured much more like corporate hierarchies than of the traditionally held military power hierarchy, with the standing legions of angels and demons even reminiscent of the EIC. People have always made analogies between indescribable things with the most complex thing of the day, much like how the brain was thought to be akin to a church organ, then a menagerie box, then a computer, and then—well, a computer is a pretty good comparison. So it falls in line that early speculation on the nature of heaven and hell would have it be to a military and that the contemporary take models it on bureaucracy. And yet that’s THE subversive detail — while reading, we interpret it as if Heaven and Hell are just seemingly in set with human modality — it reverses the time old human impressing upon Kabbalah and suggests instead that the divine and occult fully take on after US. That’s partly why I think whatever the book suggests about Aziraphale and Crowley’s sides go beyond being novel to being profound; it follows our intuition about biblical nature and as such its subversion feels natural. Even at the most basal level Heaven and Hell are just like us — we set up administrative systems seemingly for fun, but since they’re *Heaven and Hell* they manage to take on a kafkaesque element faster than a duck to water. I love this book and show to bits."
Good Omens,4,"April 4, 2019","Meanwhile Aziraphale and Crowley, who are basically middle managers from Heaven and Hell, have come to enjoy the food and music on earth, and they do not want it to end. They join forces to sabotage the plan of their respective superiors whose bureaucracy is as Kafkaesque as it is on earth."
Little Dorrit,4,"March 23, 2022","In this classic story, Arthur Clennam returns home from China after many years of absence and finds the same dull and uninviting London house with the same resentful mother inside. While he meditates on what to do next with his life, his attention is drawn to a very timid seamstress of his mother– Amy Dorrit (nicknamed “Little Dorrit”). This young woman is hard-working, kind and is blindly devoted to her imprisoned family members. This makes Arthur wonder about her life, and his first step to make poor Amy his friend leads him to the discovery of another world – the world of London’s poor. Arthur is amazed to find that the absurd workings of the notorious Marshalsea prison for debtors, where Amy was born and her father is now imprisoned, should have a symbiotic relationship with the bureaucratic realm of the complacent and Kafkaesque Circumlocution Office, a governmental institution designed to keep the needy poor and the desperate for answers – even more confused."
Little Dorrit,4,"March 24, 2022","This took an age to read, I was waylaid in the kafkaesque circumlocution office for far too long. Not my favorite Dickens (that would be David Copperfield) but I am glad I've finally read it. Amy Dorrit, the Little Dorrit of the title is a retiring self-sacrificing young woman, who was born in the Marchelsea Prison for debtors, where her father was incarcerated. There is a lot about imprisonment in the book, Dickens himself knew debtor's prisons all too well, his father having been imprisoned for debt. As with all Dickens novels there is a cast of colorful characters, there are many rogues and villains. There are travels in France, Switzerland and Italy but the book returns to London, a city well known in Dickens' writings. I have far more to say about this book, but I'll stop here for now to process what I have just read."
Little Dorrit,3,"August 21, 2023","There's the usual stuff about class, wealth and poverty, with brilliant observations as always by Dickens. The circumlocution office was awesome as well, hilarious and proto-Kafkaesque."
Little Dorrit,4,"July 26, 2010","I was intrigued by the interpersonal relationship between Arthur Clennam and Daniel Doyce in their entrepreneurial engineering partnership; the Kafkaesque attempts by Arthur Clennam to navigate the bureaucracy of the Circumlocution Office; and the eerie parallels between the precipitation, discovery and repercussions of Mr. Merdle's financial swindle and the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme."
The Martian Chronicles,4,"September 2, 2024","4.5* rounded down - The Martian Chronicles is a collection of short stories woven together by adventure and speculations on the effects of human colonization of mars. There’s a combination of hilarity including obdurate bachelors and parodies of suburban American culture, sadly beautiful, touching stories of personal identity and loneliness, Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmares, a dark ode to Edgar Alle Poe with a clear anti-censorship message, Johnny Appleseed-like mythology, and many other creative forays into the central theme. Obviously, the quality of individual stories would vary in such a diverse mixture and cater to different tastes, but it is precisely this variety that makes the work commendable."
The Martian Chronicles,3,"May 10, 2017","Despite Bradbury's characteristically beautiful prose, the Martian Chronicles suffers from the passing of time more than most science fiction. Written in the age of the atom, the stories can only be enjoyed allegorically, as they are otherwise scientifically naive. It's all boundless opportunities mixed with the echoes of World War 2, to make a Kafkaesque descent from absurd miscommunication to humanity's doom."
The Martian Chronicles,5,"June 25, 2023","Loved this book, and not at all what I expected. Not like most science fiction at all -- more like Mars used as a setting for kafkaesque explorations of human society, personalities, encounters. A little preachy in places, but just brilliant."
The Martian Chronicles,5,"October 2, 2016","There were of course many changes and compressions of the original material to fit it all into the TV series, but there is at least one major complete excision as the TV series portrayed three original missions to Mars when the book actually depicts four. Bradbury’s story of the second expedition in book is Kafkaesque and bleak and gave me a powerful new set of Martian Chronicles images to hold in my mind that bear no connection to a TV show."
before the law,4,"December 2, 2019","‘Before the law’ is one of the most important works by Kafka. Although The plot is so self-evident that it apparently defies further explanation, however the story is a great allegory to the system of law, which in fact may be interpreted in so many different ways and that’s the beauty of Kafka- Kafkaesque world. The parable is invariably recognized as the center piece of ‘The Trial’ by Kafka. It is a cruel game wherein you’ve been thrown (you own consent is not taken for it, for it doesn’t matter); now you’ve no choice but to play. The rules of the game are surreptitious and unknown to you, the mysterious maze is cruel to the most probable intensity as you are trapped in bizarre situation, which you neither understand nor can escape- perfect Kafkaesque world or perhaps represents the life itself."
before the law,4,"October 16, 2022",There are also absurdist connotations; it is (naturally) Kafkaesque.
before the law,4,"May 8, 2019","Kafka has done it again. A perfectly Kafkaesque scenario in less than a page of text. ""Before the Law stands a gatekeeper."" The gatekeeper represents arbitrary authority. Yet he is ""only the most lowly gatekeeper."" Here we have absurd hierarchy. The man before the gatekeeper is universal strife against such authority. He thinks ""The law should always be accessible for everyone,"" but is quickly discouraged from such radical ideas by the affluent and daunting gatekeeper. Even when the man begins to notice flaws about the gatekeeper, he remains isolated and submissive. Dutifully in stalemate the Man and the Gatekeeper stay for their entire lives. The Gatekeeper spends all of his time idly preventing the man's ""entry into the law."" The man suffers his entire life with desire for this entry. Tragically, it is an ill-conceived desire for a vague, unattainable goal that the entire System creates, reinforces, and perpetuates."
before the law,4,"August 23, 2023",A wonderfully nonsensical yet accurate piece of work that fits right into the category of ‘Kafkaesque’.
before the law,5,"March 19, 2022","'Before the Law' is perhaps one of Kafka's best works, despite its short length. Beyond how it resonates with criticism of the modern system of law, it creates a clear story that speaks deeply to the futility of humans to the laws of nature. This is typical of Kafkaesque worlds, of course, but I just fell in love with this specific parable (and The Trial wholly). While other Kafka works occasionally leave me struggling to overcome hurdles of comprehension, The Law is an understandably vague concept and functions like the proverbial Archimedean point in the sense that humans cannot ever wrap their heads around such a presence. It is effective, short, and sweet. I definitely suggest that Kafka or legal philosophy fans read this!"
before the law,5,"May 14, 2025",Very kafkaesque
before the law,5,"July 10, 2019","Came across this work when reading Derrida. It is very similar, almost identical, to a chapter in Kafka’s The Trial. It is written beautifully, but what is most appealing, as with all his texts, is the Kafkaesque character of it. It is no wonder that his texts, this in particular, have been subjected to a lot of studies within post-structuralist academia. ”Before the Law” makes the reader aware of the pre-discursive impossibility of anything. How we are formed in and out of language, at the same time that we are performatively forming it. It is a great litterary work; a must-read for anyone diving into European classics, and East European classics in particular. But more than that, it is an excellent introduction to much of the French and French insipired philosophy of Derrida to Butler."
before the law,3,"April 12, 2023","More misery from Mr. Kafka...reminds me of the Atlanta episode where Earn waits for a week in a Rally's restroom hoping to be allowed through the door to meet D'Angelou, who in a Kafkaesque twist isn't D'Angelou anyway."
Our Man in Havana,5,"December 14, 2009","Brilliant little kafkaesque ""spy"" novel - interesting examination into the idea of actually becoming what people erroneously assume you to be, simply by virtue of their belief."
Our Man in Havana,5,"May 25, 2016","In many ways, Greene has subverted the common tropes of the James Bond novels in Our Man in Havana. Jim Wormold, heckled father, failing businessman and a nobody in Havana, hardly fits the glamorous image of the spy made common by Hollywood. His handler, Henry Hawthorne, acts the trope when with Wormold, glibly recruiting him in a lavatory and surreptitiously passing off a key to a room in the Seville-Biltmore hotel that is surely inspired by dead-drops, but becomes a sycophantic careerist when at headquarters, and passes off Wormold as a ""merchant-king"" in Havana to impress his bosses. But most importantly, there is no antagonist threatening the world (or democracy, which meant the same in Cold War-era spy fiction) with a diabolical plan. Instead, there is a hapless man caught up in a web of deceit, spun by him but out of material supplied by others, a helpless character caught in an absurd situation that is Kafkaesque but for the fact that he has dug his own hole through the course of the book. The one antagonist that the book does provide is a stammering, sulky, insecure man who dies offstage, nothing like the colourful Bond villains that are as much part of Bond lore as the famed Bond girls."
Our Man in Havana,3,"April 10, 2017",A Kafkaesque satire examining the nature a spy-craft and how it appears to a self-effacing man caught in it.
surely you re joking mr feynman,5,"September 2, 2016","There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority."
Sostiene Pereira,5,"August 31, 2019","Sostiene Pereira, or as it is titled in English ‘Pereira Maintains’, is a story of an ordinary man in a time of crisis. It is a Kafkaesque novel that revolves around the life of Pereira, the editor of the culture page in the catholic daily ‘Lisboa’. He is a middle-aged, anxious and overweight widower who has a very limited private life since his wife’s death."
Sostiene Pereira,5,"December 17, 2021","Tabucchi really captivated me with his plain style, his picturesque landscapes tinged with nostalgia and the Kafkaesque atmosphere he creates. He really makes this story very realistic because it never verges into sensationalism."
Sostiene Pereira,3,"July 24, 2024","3.5 stars.. a slow burner despite its brevity. Quite Kafkaesque. Until the very end there is very little in the way of external events, but just a gradual shift in Pereira’s thinking and being. Beautiful dreams are alluded to but never described as Pereira’s waking life becomes incrementally more oppressive. The sense of loneliness is palpable. I don’t know much about Portuguese history - this was an interesting snippet."
strangers on a train,5,"January 16, 2015",Tense. Frightening. Tragic. Real madness may come from the simplest ideas and totally by chance. Dark. Disturbing. Kafkaesque. A trap one may hardly escape from. A masterpiece of thriller!!!
Die Panne,5,"December 28, 2021","Un univers kafkaesque, de la manipulation, de l'intensité, de l'absurde, de l'humain, et une fin à la hauteur ❤️"
i who have never known men,4,"June 12, 2024","Not your typical airplane read, but it did very well. A very Kafkaesque read, just the way I like it - full of unanswered questions and an atmosphere of unease, helplessness and a lack of control."
i who have never known men,4,"March 12, 2025","beautiful prose, well developed voice from the main character. makes you think about humanity at its most stripped back form - but especially femininity. this book would’ve played out so differently if it were “i who have never known women.” the landscape made me feel so deeply sad, but i’d recommend for a quick yet thoughtful read. think i’d be able to read this multiple times and learn something new - very kafkaesque."
i who have never known men,4,"December 26, 2024","The book places a strong emphasis on this new, degenerated normality, reminiscent of some of the greatest atrocities in human history. Concepts such as friendship, affection, memory, and recollection are redefined. The guards never touched the women, nor did they speak to them. The women were also forbidden from touching each other in the bunker—no one could help another, offer comfort, or console through touch. The women, including the narrator, lost their reproductive abilities. Suicide was strictly prohibited. The guards’ desire to keep the women alive led the women to believe that the guards had some kind of plan for them. They were denied sanitary towels and toilet paper. None of the women knew the reason for their captivity or why they were kept alive. The theory that the guards themselves were victims of this macabre experiment seems very plausible. With such a Kafkaesque atmosphere, we have access only to the narrator’s inner world in this absurd and sinister context—one that remains absurd and sinister until the very end."
i who have never known men,5,"December 9, 2024",Rare that a book earns descriptors like «&nbsp;kafkaesque&nbsp;» and «&nbsp;arresting&nbsp;» but this one…..
i who have never known men,5,"July 10, 2025",very kafkaesque but also beautiful and heartbreaking
i who have never known men,5,"April 7, 2024","During the imprisonment in the bunker the narrator is the youngest, in her teens– she is isolated because of her age and constraints imposed on the women. The narrator was the only one who had been a child when they were all locked up. Older women thought that the narrator was locked up by mistake as when their memories became clearer, they remembered that only adults were rounded up. None of them seemed to have any coherent memories that would allow them to piece together what happened. Among women there were stories of brainwashing, genetic engineering and robots so sophisticated that were mistaken for human beings or their situation might have been a result of some Kafkaesque administrative blunder."
i who have never known men,3,"July 11, 2024","The story itself is creative and written at a fine pace, depicting what it means to be a person, a woman, and part of a society. The main character is a blank slate to which she builds her personality and character through learning. The author attempts to build an eerie air of the absurd through her descriptions of tangible things that we take for granted (a chair, bread, etc.) as well as abstract things (religion, culture, and interpersonal relationships) that the main character must attribute meaning to without knowledge of its purpose. I only consider this an attempt because the book was extremely redundant and not intellectually stimulating, which was disappointing considering that the reviews stated that this book was Kafkaesque."
i who have never known men,5,"March 6, 2025","if anything could be described as kafkaesque it is this book, though I don’t really want to ascribe this book’s unique way of viewing humanity to one specific box. But if you’re looking through reviews like “oh what sort of philosophy does this align with?”…."
i who have never known men,4,"April 13, 2023","while it usually bothers me a lot when an author doesn’t give us an explanation, it really fit this kafkaesque story."
i who have never known men,5,"June 23, 2025","An anonymous narrator, raised in a cage with 39 other women, without memory of her previous life nor they came to be imprisoned. A Kafkaesque existential classic."
the overwhelming urge,4,"June 28, 2008","When Prunty succeeds, he creates a vision to rival the best scenes out of Lynch (and yes, often the darkest works, like Eraserhead or Lost Highway). When he fails, it's a joke with no punchline, or a too obvious punchline. ""Prince,"" in which the narrator finds himself inexplicably babysitting the rock god--who is now a geriatric teenager--flops flat on its purple lame belly. ""Void"" (""I have a bowel movement that lasts for three days"") inexplicably discovers a Kafkaesque tale of strange beauty in extremely disgusting, scatological circumstances. ""Vagina"" and ""The Joke"" both work their stiletto heels beautifully on the literary runway. ""Shoes"" and ""The Johnsons"" are both too close to pieces in Martin's Cruel Shoes for my liking. ""Frogs"" is hilarious and filmic. Andersen better watch that one doesn't get cribbed. I expect some screenwriter to steal that baby from him."
the overwhelming urge,4,"August 30, 2008","Flash Fiction is very difficult. You can make it into a bad joke, an irritating pretentious koan or a dull Jeremiad if you're not careful with it. Its malleability and the potential misuses of it have always reminded me of improv comedy. Improv comedy can generate chuckles, paroxysms of laughter or shrugs. The Overwhelming Urge by Andersen has none of the latter (immensely to his credit) a substantial amount of paroxysms and a couple of chuckles. But with this laughter comes an observation of aberrant human behavior, which, coupled with the comedy brings to mind the darker moments of Mr. Show, Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizen's Brigade. The stories are thought provoking funny and exciting, the desperation of his story ""Vagina"" aches, the trueness of ""Drugs"" evokes a small shudder with the laughter and ""Discovering the Shape of My Skull"" is a strangely compelling, bittersweet Kafkaesque nightmare. My sole complaint about the collection is one of personal preference. I would have preferred more stories like ""Vagina"" and fewer moments of broad-ish comedy. A good laugh, a good thinkpiece and a virtuoso use of a difficult form. I can only hope my own flash fiction could someday be at this level."
The Brothers Karamazov,4,"April 25, 2015","There is the mood that I take issue with. Maybe it is the translation; maybe it’s the game with Russian literature in general: but there is the oppressive Kafkaesque sort of absurd that just lingers over the bulk of the novel, even when it ought not to. The Brothers K isn’t at all like the Notes from Underground: it needs the oxygen of realism to really work as a work of literature. I just don’t feel that enough here. If the Brothers K had been an English work I’d pillory it for this, but as it is I can’t. It’s a shame though, because it could have been absolutely amazing. But when I can never immerse myself absolutely into a book, I can never buy the narrative a hundred percent. And the characters, no matter how well limned otherwise, just don’t come across as real."
klara and the sun,4,"February 15, 2024",Kafkaesque Tale of AI and human experience.
klara and the sun,4,"October 10, 2021","Ishiguro is a dab hand at taking genred stories and giving them his own particular slant. He's done the Kafkaesque nightmare (The Unconsoled), the period drama (Remains of the Day), fantasy (Buried Giant) and dark, romantic dystopia (Never Let Me Go), always maintaining his own style and stamp. Klara and the Sun has the high stakes of being his first novel with the Nobel prize winner label and it's appropriately ambitious. Here Ishiguro turns to Asimovian science fiction but he throws in handfuls of seemingly disparate ingredients to freshen up this robotic future. At its heart, Klara and the Sun looks at the same concerns: the line between man and machine and the anxieties that produces in our sense of what it means to be human. But Klara, an AF (Artificial Friend), spans a timescale that begins somewhere around Frankenstein and runs all the way to very modern technological worries about the way children interact with technology. Cleverly, this robotic friend merges the feel of many children's books that explore our relationship with toys and imaginary friends, the notion of toy coming alive at night, little voyeurs in our bedrooms, creation a novel that combines Asimovian principles with Pixar's Toy Story."
klara and the sun,4,"May 18, 2024","We live in the age of both information and simulacra. It appears we can not only ingest copious amounts of knowledge but draw subjective and archaic conclusions from mere ether as a shameless effrontery to it as well. We both fear and admire the promise of artificial intelligence with as much energy as we feel for the restoration and development of the world and its natural processes. A respect that is so much a given that it's taken for granted. From it we get speculative fiction centered around A.I. The future it encompasses. Kazuo Ishuguro's Klara and the Sun, however, feels more like a Kafkaesque dream than an Asimovian premonition. All the same, it's effectual and engaging, seen from the eyes of it's eponymous Klara, an Artificial Friend, or AF, devices created to accompany and sometimes accommodate youths during a transitional period of their lives, which includes fatal illness. Klara's relationship with her human Josie and her family is painted by the programming allowing a strange omniscient perimeter to exist while Klara takes the initiative to do what is best for Josie's wellbeing and survival as well as that of the people who love and care for Josie the most. The condition of her programming, or something more human? An AF is warned that they are products and learn harsh lessons about the fickle behavior of children, but there's a link there as well. This is a world where science giveth as well as taketh away, where the AF develop their own beatific concepts, that there has to be a higher authoritative figure that still gives as much as it takes. In the end a function is served. Just as nature intended."
all the light we cannot see,5,"July 3, 2019","As much as I found Marie-Laure's half of the story moving, it was really Werner's journey through the Kafkaesque world that was Nazi Germany that really struck a chord with me. Dealt a bad hand in life, Werner, possessing a keen mind, only ever has two options in front of him: (i) to work in the mines and die there or (ii) join the forces and become a Nazi youth. Werner successfully navigates through the hardships making use of his astute mind. To adapt to your environment without letting it change you is no easy feat."
The Hour of the Star,4,"August 15, 2024","The narrative style is very Kafkaesque, and the narrator himself and his subject of focus Macabéa are reminiscent of some sort of amalgamation of Melville’s Bartleby, Kafka’s Gregor, and Plath’s Esther all wrapped into two parallel and tragic literary figures. Lispector utilizes her author as a mouthpiece for the existential and absurd realities that plague all of us when confronting life and our purpose in it. Yet, at the same time the narrator is using Macabéa as a mirror for his own confusions, exhaustion, and feelings of emotional and cosmic ineptitude."
The Hour of the Star,4,"October 3, 2023","Also I was mocked for not having read any Kafka so I thought that by reading Clarice Lispector I could understand the Kafkaesque without any giant bugs. Who’s laughing now? I make no claims as to fully understanding this book nor its place in literary history, but I quite enjoyed it."
The Hour of the Star,3,"March 24, 2024","I need to come back to review this. The great, clearly is the unique narrative style Lispector has created, enjoyable where the many interesting bits of philosophical trivia are dispersed throughout the novel. Still, whenever things drift into the Kafkaesque I hesitate to come along for the ride."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"December 9, 2022",so kafkaesque.
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"January 5, 2015","As usual the story was KAFKAESQUE. Better read it, its a very short one, though thought provoking."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,5,"July 18, 2025","Indeed, Kafka and Kafkaesque are notions that come up in conversation, films, other books or plays, one example is…Kafka’s Dick http://realini.blogspot.com/2016/07/k... so we could argue that even the penis of the immortal author has entered history, Alan Bennett is not a second rate scribbler, he has some fantastic oeuvres, such as The Uncommon Reader (wherein the Queen of Britain starts…reading and that is causing a furor) The History Boys, 40 Years On"
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"May 27, 2016","I had never read any Kafka before beginning this collection, but I had heard the term Kafkaesque thrown around a lot. Based on my understanding of the term, I expected a collection of overwhelmingly oppressive, Orwellian stories about the little man being at the mercy of the larger man and the vindictive universe as a whole. Instead, what I got was a single story about a man turned into a cockroach and a number of sweet little stories about people wondering about their place in the world and what else their might be. And rather than an overbearing narrative style meant to show the futility of it all, there was nothing but simple (albeit borderline run-on) sentences describing things rather plainly. For example, Metamorphosis doesn't concern itself with the character cursing the universe or tearing his antennae out wondering why he's a cockroach. Instead, Gregor is more concerned with his relationship to his family and how his condition affects them. I was delightfully surprised at the matter of fairness of it all. The collection precedes Metamorphosis with Kafka's first group of short stories which barely last longer than two pages, but effectively create an atmosphere and setting better than full length novels. The second collection of shorts, A Country Doctor: Short Prose for my Father, is the the weakest of the whole book as it lacks the charm and bright-eyed wonderment at the absurdity of life that the preceding stories have in abundance. The third collection of shorts feel the most ""Kafkaesque"" and are far more negative than the other works in this book; however, they are appealing in their negativity. I loved reading this book and Kafka has become one of my favorite writers. I can't wait to read more of his works."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"January 13, 2023","“One morning, upon awakening from agitated dreams, Gregor Samsa found himself, in his bed, transformed into a monstrous vermin.” One of literature’s iconic opening sentences. But it is as if the novella has nowhere to go after this knock-out start. With Gregor irremediably transformed into a bug, there is no scope for Kafkaesque anxieties relating to overbearing father figures, sexually aggressive women, or arbitrarily punitive bureaucracy. And while Gregor struggles with endless obstacles, they are more pedestrian than in many of Kafka’s works (how can a bug turn over and move about, etc.) Overall, I found that Metamorphosis underdelivered. Published 1915."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,2,"February 14, 2009","Striving to understand the frequent usage of ""Kafkaesque"" to describe a proliferation of things literary, I found a nice bargain copy of this translation of Kafka many moons past. I'm unsure if I accomplished my goal, being left wondering if I need to read The Trial to solidify that understanding, yet having no desire to engage anymore with his works. This collection of stories left me repulsed (""The Metamorphosis""), disgusted (""In the Penal Colony""), irritated (""The Stoker""), or bored (all inclusive). I used the experience as a stylistic exercise, but even that failed to render the stories any more approachable for me. Taking a month to finally finish, the slow progress was a source of frustration, and the more frustrating thought is that Kafka would have probably found that entirely too funny."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"March 26, 2024","Kafka is not much like what I expected, which is somewhat shocking given how much of his oeuvre has made it into the mainstream literary community. I stress that it's made it into the *community* and not especially the canon (though I think it's more than fair to say that Kafka is canonized) because, for the most part, it's surprisingly difficult finding people with specific observations about Kafka's works. There are a lot of attempts to pin down his aesthetics and what it means to be ""Kafkaesque"" without, in my opinion, a lot of reckoning with what Kafka actually wrote about, how his stories *worked*. They're not your typical stories, certainly not the usual fair in the early 20th century when they were written. No-- people seem to be more interested in his autobiographical elements, how he is the archetypal genius who was never appreciated in his time, his tragic relationship with his father, his mastery of love letters. His monument seems to be dedicated to Weird Little Freaks (without getting into what makes him weird, little, or a freak) and not to literature."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,5,"February 28, 2021","Reading this was so rewarding...it’s been awhile since I picked up Kafka (German or English) but it beckoned me for some reason. I had never read In the Penal Colony or The Hunger Artist, and I remembered The Trial and The Country Doctor only vaguely. What I found is that, the more I read the stories, the more absurd and vaguely ominous certain things in my own life / work-life started seeming. Reading Kafka gives you a kind of consciousness that suddenly makes the Kafkaesque come to life in your own world. Loved experiencing this, despite the discomfort."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"January 18, 2024",I finally understand the term kafkaesque. The Metamorphosis and A Report to An Academy were the highlights for me personally.
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,5,"September 1, 2024",There are multiple derivations of this story and the more you think about it the more you realize how they differently fit into the mundane narratives of our lives. This is what we call ‘Kafkaesque’.
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"June 24, 2016","So, I read this in search of wtf ""Kafkaesque"" means and I decided that it means that this guy kept a dream journal.

And we dig and dig and think omg this is soooo deep, his expression of guilt or loss of self worth or manhood. and family, whoa, this expression of family; are they just horrible people or are they good people in a horrible situation? What does this say about me? and, letbehonest, some of them are just ramblings. Just weird. random. ramblings. about a minute in the day in the life of this guy. and lists. there are lists of people. factory inspectors? check. sons? check. check. check. check. check. check. check. check. check. check. check. yeah, there were eleven. all horrible in their own little way."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,5,"January 22, 2025","I was much more impressed with ""The Metamorphosis"" than the first time I read it as a junior in high school. A common interpretation of the story relates to disability and the strain it places on both the disabled person and their family. While definitely a valid reading, the meaning I drew from the short story is from a Marxist lens. Gregor Samsa is the primary wage earner in his family unit. His incapacitation renders his family destitute, but also highlights the transactional nature their relationships had become. As soon as Gregor was no longer useful from an economic standpoint, his mother and father rejected him. I believe Kafka was commenting on the extent capitalist philosophy had pervaded all aspects of life. Even blood ties mean nothing when there is no longer a material advantage to the relationship. As for the other stories included in this edition, ""In the Penal Colony"" was by far my favorite. A tale about the machine, in my mind it embodied the traditional Kafkaesque element."

The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,Not rated,"February 20, 2025","It took a few stories to click for me but I do think I can now somewhat confidently use the adjective 'Kafkaesque'. I would use it to describe that which focuses on the anxiety, suffering and senselessness which are a part of of existence but also the necessity to endure and persevere. Stoicism in the face of absurdism! Living and working and loving and dying in a world which is bewildering and unconscionable. Something we all must do in this crazy year of our lord 2025!"
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"June 22, 2023","A short story collection that gives you all the over – and under – tones of what we call Kafkaesque. Stories reminiscent of Chekhov and Borges, that invite you in like a lover with a playful gesture, pique your imagination for a quick surreal encounter, or set you up for a moralistic parable, but invariably and unerringly cast you into the nightmarish world of arbitrary rules and unintelligible motives. The authorities are nameless, the bureaucracy is maddening, and frustration is perpetual. No sooner do you find your footing than the ground shifts; the hero myth descends into lunacy; morality cries out ‘Neti, Neti, Neti’."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"December 30, 2022","""The Penal Colony"" is creepy; ""The Hunger Artist"" seems less and less Kafkaesque. I mean, some of the tricks David Blaine has pulled are something similar to ""The Hunger Artist."""

The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"January 6, 2021",I can finally state with glory that I have dipped my toes into the great workings of the one and only Franz Kafka. I finally have a well rounded understanding of the phenomenon that is “Kafkaesque”.
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"January 30, 2022","A great edition collecting everything Kafka published in his lifetime. This is the entirety of Kafka's work that he thought the world should read, all he ostensibly wanted to see the light of day. Everything else to be burned. Thank god that didn't happen. ""The Metamorphosis"" has obvious merit but it is probably my least favourite of his stories--it's just so gloomy and suffocating in a way that lacks a certain ambiguity found in his other works, and it is that Kafkaesque brand of ambiguity that I find most impactful, in a vague sort of way."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,2,"September 9, 2009","The adjective ""kafkaesque"" has come to connote anything that is weird, creepy, anomalous, surrealistic, etc., and this collection of stories certainly testifies to that definition. ""The Metamorphosis"" is the most comprehensible of the stories, in my opinion, although the premise is pretty bizarre: A young German salesman wakes up one morning and finds he has inexplicably become transformed into a giant cockroach. The way his family reacts to his plight is unexpected and distressing. My interpretation of the theme is that self-sacrifice is useless and futile. The other major story, ""The Penal Colony,"" is even more cruel and disturbing, and it involves some pretty graphic and sadistic torture. I know I said in a review of the Harry Potter books that I tolerate J.K. Rowling's borrowing of ideas from other works, but I think she went a little too far with Kafka. There is a scene in book five--Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix--that is such a blatant rip-off of ""The Penal Colony,"" that if Kafka were still alive, he could probably sue Rowling---and win. Still, I don't mind that Rowling took that bit of cruelty and applied it skillfully to one of her despicable characters. I would guess that Kafka is not widely read outside of certain academic circles, and giving the wider reading public a little dose of the ""kafkaesque"" has probably proved at least somewhat thought-provoking in our current pop culture."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,3,"October 28, 2007","So I finally got around to reading The Metamorphosis. It was definitely a gaping hole in my (fairly comprehensive) literary knowledge. I read it and a couple other stories. And I still feel like I have a gaping hole in my literary knowledge. As you read a Kafka story, you're like, okay, this is weird...okay...still weird...it ends...wait, what? I always knew loosely what that term Kafkaesque meant, but now I get it. I really do. Only, I don't. Ta da! Kafka."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,3,"July 21, 2014","3 stars seems a bit low but it corresponds to 'liking it', which is true. I borrowed this book because I heard the adjective 'Kafkaesque' applied a LOT of times to other authors' works (Murakami included), so I wanted to see what he was all about."
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,Not rated,"September 8, 2014",Kafkaesque
The Metamorphosis In the Penal Colony and Other Stories,4,"March 13, 2020",Very Kafkaesque.
The Garden Party and Other Plays,4,"December 30, 2014","In a Kafkaesque environment conveyed by repetitive dialogue and a confused sense of time, Hugo successfully climbs the Czechoslovakian civil service ladder, at some cost to his personal identity. It still has the potential to chime with the modern corporate or public sector environment, though the sense of boredom and slow fear situates it historically."
The Marquise of O and Other Stories,5,"November 28, 2014","This is also the case in ""Michael Kohlhaas"" where the protagonist takes the law into his own hands after repeated attempts to bring legal action against a man who is terrorizing the community. This kind of Kafkaesque critique of the law is also carried out to the extreme limits of surrealism, rendering reality as nightmarish in much the same way Kafka would do later. Of the shorter pieces collected here, ""The Foundling"" is the strongest and seems to speak to the same examination of reality versus fantasy in Hoffmann's ""The Sandman."" However, it is in the longer tales that von Kleist is able to enlarge his canvas and allow his oddly distorted syntax and phrasing to loop in and out of sense and nonsense most elegantly."
Seeing,4,"November 1, 2020","While this partly operates as a sequel to Blindness, it also has a different tone, more Kafkaesque as Saramago guts the workings of a 'party on the right' government faced with the quiet subversion of a populace who leave their voting papers blank. For all the Government's self-righteous rhetoric about the undermining of democracy, they themselves have easy recourse to activities that are, of course, distinctly undemocratic: spying, interrogating without reason, torturing and terrorising the people they are supposed to protect and on whose behalf they are supposed to work."
Seeing,4,"June 10, 2008","Very timely book to read in 2008 - as it takes place in the same city that the ""blindness"" swept through not 4 years earlier. However this book doesn't revolve around the mystery of a white blindness epidemic, it revolves around an election and a blank-votes scandal. The theme or underlying motif seems to be ""There are none as blind as those who do not see"". I think I enjoyed reading this book almost as much as reading the first because both stories are very Kafkaesque and I am a huge Kafka fan. I enjoyed this!"
Seeing,3,"June 30, 2020","2.5 stars. Not really a sequel, it just reuses the characters from Blindness in what’s a fairly mundane Kafkaesque damnation of capitalist democracy. Just like Kafka it got quite tedious and a little boring by the end as the joke really stated growing old."
Seeing,5,"January 19, 2021","I just loved the absurdity of it, both the story and the very particular writing style just really put me into this nice and interesting headspace. I didn't want to use the K word to describe it, but truth is it just felt nicely kafkaesque to me. I feel like he really scratched away at the hidden totalitarianism within representative democracy, and I really appreciated that irony being drawn out."
Seeing,3,"April 15, 2021","Kafkaesque. A bit Nabokovian. And, especially toward the end, quite Beckettish."
Absurdistan,4,"April 27, 2007","Ultimately, Vainberg embarks on a kafkaesque trip to Absurdsvani, a small country in the Caucasus, where he gets screwed over again and again. A series of cultural gags and defense-contractor jokes quickly become menacing, as the country spirals into horrible civil war. Ever the ill-advised naif, Vainberg hooks up with an important local lady, leading to further misfortunes. As the city is razed by warring factions, Vainberg confronts the supreme horror and nihilism of war. His melancholy ass is kicked around until he detaches from his precious ego, loses weight, and finally meets the few good people who save his life."
Absurdistan,Not rated,"August 10, 2011","Best taken in doses. *C'est très bizarre*, of course. That experience was not so much out-of-body but full-bodied hyperrealism of a Ron Mueck sculpture in the massive person of character Misha Vainberg and the shenanigans of his scarred *khui*, the result of a botched snipping. The inexacting canard on which flights of the absurd in this mild Kafkaesque melodrama take off are spent in a jumble of encounters and asymptotes of encounters. The characters are memorable, the comic plot insane, and the dilemmas a quest as much as a question of identity, be it Russian, Jewish, American, Sevo, Sväni, footrest, Golly Burton, what have you. The most arresting and touching chapters, my favourites, are chapter 11: Lyuba Vainberg Invites Me to Tea, and chapter 37: The End."
Nausea,5,"March 28, 2021","Philosophers can be incisive storytellers - and have been since the earliest days of discipline. The most memorable passages in Plato's Republic deal with his allegory of the cave, which cleverly takes the most abstract part of his philosophy - unavoidably abstract because our philosopher is trying to explain the specifics of the Platonic theory of ideas - and brings it to life for his audience as a kind of Kafkaesque fantasy tale. In later years, philosophers didn't forget the power of fiction to bring bold ideas to life. Sir Thomas More presented his alternative to Plato, his so-called Utopia, in the form of story. And philosophers presided over the birth of the novel, even before the days of Fielding, Richardson and Defoe."
Nausea,4,"May 29, 2025",Was it me or this book was more kafkaesque than Kafka's works
Nausea,4,"February 7, 2019","Alluding to the famous tram scene where the seats have revealed to him their true existence, which isn’t a seat at all but it’s composite parts: the fabric, wood, springs etc. This appears kafkaesque to him in that the tram turns into a “huge belly turns upwards, bleeding, puffed up”"
my year of rest and relaxation,4,"March 23, 2022","It’s the year 2000, and our unnamed, young, thin, rich, beautiful blonde narrator and recent Columbia-graduate should be satisfied with her life. Except that she isn’t, so she decides to slowly escalate her use of her prescription meds, and to just sleep for a year. After all, that’s not as drastic or permanent as suicide, and she may be able to look at everything with new eyes after having rested—it’s a totally fucked-up approach to “self-care”, and there’s something faintly Kafkaesque about it; a different kind of metamorphosis. As preposterous as that premise (and the logistics of it) alone sounds, she’s an orphan from a WASP family with a hefty inheritance, collects unemployment checks, and only keeps one friend jealous of her wealth and appearance around, so she can actually sort of get away with it. It’s still an absolutely bonkers concept, but if you can roll with the ridiculousness of it all, I dare say it pays off."
my year of rest and relaxation,2,"August 21, 2022","I guess the book was OK, but to be honest, I’m actually slightly disappointed. While I enjoyed the first 25% of the book, the first daily struggles of the protagonist, the rest was just… pointless. The protagonist is not a very likeable character. While the annotation promises “a tender read”, this felt more like the ramblings of a spoiled, arrogant twenty-year-old. Slightly Kafkaesque and unreal. I read this book right after finishing “The Bell Jar”. Both books deal with mental health struggles, but are very different in style and aftertaste."
my year of rest and relaxation,4,"April 15, 2025","It felt Kafkaesque to some extent as well, mostly with Dr Tuttle. Every interaction with her felt alienating. But also John's own view of the world. I think this is a common occurence in Ottessa's books: an untrustworthy narrator, a distorted perception of reality."
my year of rest and relaxation,4,"January 17, 2023","Grim, surreal, Kafkaesque. My Year of Rest and Relaxation is an amazing concept first and foremost. The writing style is as precise and disinterested as one could hope for in a book about such a cold and disinterested person, yet has depth in equal measures where needed."
my year of rest and relaxation,3,"September 9, 2024",I only started to appreciate (and enjoy?) the book once I viewed it as a modern take to the Kafkaesque.

my year of rest and relaxation,5,"December 31, 2023","‘My Year of Rest and Relaxation’ instantly became a favorite read of mine because of its writing style and the way the unnamed narrator had progressed by the end. Also, I think, anyone can relate to her in such ways like the impostor syndrome she has within herself or losing the will to live and feeling...nothing. Everything about her feels very Kafkaesque. In this story, somehow it gives you the lesson that even though you have everything from wealth to beauty, we can never truly be perfect...or we can never truly be happy in just a flash."
my year of rest and relaxation,4,"November 9, 2019",And then she emerges anew in a kind of reverse Kafkaesque fashion.
my year of rest and relaxation,4,"January 26, 2023","possibly my new comfort book - strikes a vein from an indulged point of view, that is few of us would go so far as to hibernate from the world, or attempt to, completely, for a year. the existential ennui of the main character feels authentic and traps you in this psychosis-like trance as a reader, it’s not an enjoyable book to read but it is a breath of fresh air in its listlessness and recognises the sense of crisis we all so often experience in our own lives - what is the point? it makes you feel alive at the same time in its blurred kafkaesque with esther greenwood sharpness"
The Overcoat,5,"June 26, 2025","This story has a dark, miserable element to it for sure. Its grim, life is hard – a world without joy. It’s almost Kafkaesque in some ways, particularly in the closing pages. I loved this."
The Overcoat,5,"May 17, 2022","A tragic, Kafkaesque* morality tale about social isolation, bureaucracy, and the danger of judging by appearances."
The Overcoat,4,"March 19, 2025","The story kept reminding me of the term, “Kafkaesque” and I found out much later that Nikolai Gogol served as an inspiration for Franz Kafka."
The Overcoat,4,"March 22, 2022",Kafkaesque comedy.
The Overcoat,5,"December 19, 2024","Kafkaesque before Kafka, he and others would come out from under Gogol’s Overcoat. Bureaucracy, a sense of duty and status are all subject to wry wit in this story of one man’s obsession over the titular garment."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,5,"December 21, 2021","the tragicomic-magical-realism of the circular history of the buendia family in the town of macondo serves as a fatalistic and farcical facsimile of latin america. central to the plot are several reoccurring themes, gold and the search for wealth, the kafkaesque battle between liberalism and republicanism, and the exploitation/abandonment of colonialism."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,4,"January 17, 2019","Not unlike the many novels in the literary canon, 100 Years of Solitude is not an enjoyable read. The repeating rotation of family history through generations becomes redundant and difficult to follow without mixing up the repeating names and paralleling actions. But as any canonical novel, 100YOS is profound. Gabriel García Márquez drops pearls of wisdom and insight which make the arduous journey of reading about the Buendía family worth it. Márquez isn't shy about embracing his literary influences. His matter-of-fact tone when narrating an extraordinary event is faithfully Kafkaesque. Love, war, magic, lust and despair are all themes easily stylized with language, but Márquez has restraint and practices strict word economy per event and per narrative point of view. The theme of a family history as a rotating axle dooming each generation is opaquely Faulknarian. The phrases Márquez uses to describe the Buendía family – ""the crushing weight of so much past"" and ""history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions"" – can easily be used to describe the Compson family (The Sound and the Fury). There were times when I wanted to abandon this novel and pick up something with more instant gratification, but I'm so glad I made it to that ending. For anyone who is frustrated with 100YOS: read it and endure it just to reach that ending which is both heartbreaking and a relief from an axle that had trapped Macondo and the Buendías in its doomed rotations for a century."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,4,"June 3, 2020","Just like Naguib Mahfouz, Márquez, smartly and with great talent, made a history story-book, not of governments or of formal institutions of the sort which keeps public records, but of a people who are best understood in terms of their relationship to a single family throughout its generations..keeping us in division and incomprehension most of the time while reading this masterpiece which is filled with intense doses of magic realism, mythical symbolism and surrealistic ‘Kafkaesque’ marvels!"
House of Leaves,3,"March 26, 2021","To clarify, I don't necessarily mind long novels per se. In fact, this particular novel had many pages with only a few words on (at least a hundred of them). However, it also had significantly less plot than many books of an equivalent length. While the explorations of the dark space were fascinating, almost Kafkaesque, the digressions were frustrating at times and did sometimes remind me of that great garrulous character of literature: Tristram Shandy."
The Castle,2,"August 19, 2012","It was too, how do I say it?...Kafkaesque. But am I greater than the writer himself? No. Kafka quit too and just as mid-sentence as I--only later in the text. Evidently, he died of tedium. Thank goodness I stopped before Kafka's work killed me too."
The Castle,Not rated,"May 8, 2019",As a bonus since we read Kafka we understand the world through his eyes - Kafka creates our Weltanschauung. We understood what a Kafkaesque situation is because we have read Kafka.
The Castle,3,"June 24, 2011","It's a more mature statement on the concept of what's Kafkaesque. Bureacracies don't just fail because they're a bad idea. the failures of a bloated system come from the laziness, impatience, ineptitude, and arrogance of those involved. K is just as much a problem as everyone he encounters, and collectively they paint a picture of why bureaucracies fail. Too much corruption sends society screeching to a halt."
The Castle,4,"December 21, 2023","I swapped between two translation as I read, mostly my brain was arguing about word choices and sentence structure: nothing serious; but when I reached the end, I realised one of my translations had an extra page or two than the other. Of course, we always treat Kafka as unfinished. K. is always there where we left him. If anything, the unfinished body of work left by Kafka is part of his Kafkaesque universe. Missing pieces, disjointed chapters, inconsistencies (a few here, for example, like describing both sisters as blonde but later calling one a brunette), and above all, lacking in resolution. All the depression, loneliness, stumbling, heartache in your life is because of the castle. K. is in a world that does not yield itself to him. I said this to a friend the other day and they responded, Yes, and aren't we all? I thought about that. One day I'd like to read Anthea Bell's translation as she does such a consistently good job with Zweig. I mostly ditched Muir in favour of Underwood, the latter being based on the Pasley Critical German Text, despite the fact that Muir's (with the additional translations by Kaiser and Wilkins) is sometimes considered the 'definite' edition."

The Castle,Not rated,"July 2, 2024","It is so Kafkaesque that even Kafka himself would need a map and a flashlight to navigate its labyrinthine absurdity.

The Castle,Not rated,"August 27, 2024","I currently find myself in a Kafkaesque predicament: after a class-action settlement against an Australian university I was once employed at, I was awarded $83 in compensation for wage theft and I received a tax notice requiring me to file my lodgment on that compensation. However, since I no longer have an Australian bank account, I am not able to receive the money and nor am I able to file taxes either—because the Australian tax filing system also requires an Australian bank account. After being grossly underpaid, I now find myself in an even more frustrating bind: neither able to receive this trivial remuneration and yet still liable to taxes on it—to a country I have not worked or lived in for over a decade. I tried to contact the university but their HR support system requires a current employee email; I tried contacting the law firm that led the class-action but their identity verification system has expired (and also requires an Australian phone number...) The irony is that Australia's administrative efficiency—an online tax system, 24-hour chat support, digital IDs—has made things more onerous and more inaccessible."

'The Trial' made my list of favorites the year I read that, so it can't be because I don't like Kafka. A lot of the same elements were in both books, but I guess The Trial was just more polished. The Castle is really an unfinished book, so you have to wonder how much Kafka may have changed it if he could have. And this is one of the books Kafka never wanted to publish. If The Castle was the first Kafka book I read, I don't think I would have tried any others. While reading this, I was jokingly thinking maybe ""Kafkaesque"" means a nightmarish book that never ends, takes way too long to read and seems pretty pointless, but then the book ends in the middle of a sentence, almost like waking up in the middle of a nightmare. I'd say try The Trial."
The Castle,1,"December 30, 2013","According to Wikipedia, ""Kafkaesque"" is a term used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work- instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness."

So far, this may seem to match the associations of gloom and oppression suggested by the term ‘Kafkaesque’. Kafka, however, has much more to offer than the ‘Kafkaesque’, and if one can put aside such presuppositions, The Castle provides many surprising discoveries."
The Castle,3,"October 7, 2021","Is it still interesting and Kafkaesque, for a lack of a better word? Yes. Does it offer sharp, smart observations about power, bureaucracy and humanity? Yes! But for god’s sake, I have absolutely no idea why this is supposed to be one of the greatest works of literature known to man."
The Castle,5,"March 14, 2025",The perfect amalgamation of Kafkaesque elements and everything Kafka was. I think no ending to this book actually elevates it — and that in itself is so Kafka.
The Castle,4,"July 27, 2024",Oh man I hated reading this so much but in the best most kafkaesque way possible
The Castle,5,"May 19, 2025","When K. looked at the castle he sometimes thought he saw someone sitting quietly there, looking into space, not lost in thought and thus cut off from everything else, but free and at ease, as if he were alone and no one was observing him. He must notice that he himself was under observation, but that didn’t disturb him in the slightest, and indeed — it was hard to tell whether this was cause or effect — the observer’s eyes could find nothing to fasten on, and slipped away from the figure. This impression was reinforced today by the early coming of darkness. The longer he looked, the less he could make out, and the further everything receded into the twilight.” This moment is brief and easily missed, but powerful. might be an expression of Kafka’s spiritual and existential anxiety. K. yearns for contact, meaning, a sign. He creates one, but it's hollow, unreachable, serene in a way that excludes him. His own scrutiny undoes the vision. reinforces the Kafkaesque theme that truth slips away when you try to grasp it. The Castle's imagined figure is an archetype of grace. Klamm is the anti-archetype. obscure, aging, and ambiguous, associated with whispered affairs, locked rooms, and a thousand interpretations, none of which ever satisfy. So when K. imagines a figure looking over the village, he’s not imagining Klamm. He’s imagining a god that might exist if this system had meaning. - Gabe Porter"

The prospect of change—never mind improvement in one’s personal lot—is simply a delusion.

The Castle,4,"May 9, 2025","This was my first Kafka, and although I am planning to give his other works a go, getting through this was painful! It wasn’t uncommon for me to re-read entire sentences, trying to make sense of a paragraph, and then turn to Google for help. I realise this was part of the “Kafkaesque” experience (or perhaps the translation), but crikey—why did some dialogues need to be that complex?"
The Castle,3,"January 16, 2023","So I like The Castle for the amount of the story Kafka was able to write. Our protagonist with a one-letter name, K., does not give up easily. He has difficulties understanding the place he is in and people he is among, he keeps failing to make any progress towards apparently trivial goals, and the many-layered body of bureaucracy that reigns supreme over everything there seems positively impenetrable, but K. goes on. And I went on too, although there were many chapters, especially near the end, which felt like Kafka had intended to come back to and make more readable instead of having characters deliver ten-page rants non-stop. And just as it felt like K. was at least a little bit closer to his goals at the end, I felt like I was a little bit closer to actually understanding what people mean when they say Kafkaesque. ;)"
The Castle,5,"November 9, 2023","An amazing unpredictable story. Strange mixture of existentialism and absurde theater. Mankind as puppets on very strong but very far strings, no way out of fate in which you are thrown. Some Characters are totally in power, felt like was studying for an examination. Very complicated. I understand Kafka s brain worked that way. The Castle is a profound book and has to be read. It is an experience of the ""Kafkaesque"" par excellece. It is a must read. I recently learned it is advised to read The Castle then The Trial."
The Castle,4,"January 15, 2025","Kafka famously gave up writing this book mid sentence which is in itself compelling but is also, in my opinion, a creative choice that suits the narrative and the message Kafka is portraying. The monotony and futility of K’s quest might’ve lost its impact if it had actually come to a conclusion, satisfying or otherwise. Max Brod, friend to Kafka, claims that he has an ending in mind, with K. exhausting himself to death and finally, upon his deathbed, being granted permission to stay in the village but still, importantly, with no legitimate claim: a delightfully Kafkaesque ending, mirroring Kafka’s own experiences as a Czech Jew seeking acceptance in early 20th century Austria, but also offering a morbid outlook on life as nothing but a constant struggle in pursuit of something virtually unattainable until the bitter end. However, I think The Castle’s actual, more than abrupt end conveys (intentionally or not, Kafka supposedly quipped that he was done with the book “forever obviously” when he stopped writing) an even more menacing meaning: the continuation of K.’s unavailing battle against an unseen authority, with literally no end, not even death, portraying life as a struggle for something not just virtually, but literally unattainable, with no conceivable end… Heavy reading for New Year’s Eve…!"
The Castle,4,"January 31, 2024","Apart from wanting to finish the book, Kafka (would he not have burned this work like the most of the rest) might have liked to make some edits to what may have been his masterpiece. In particular I found the entire section about Amalia two bits too long and quite momentum-breaking. As for the rest, this novel features some of the world’s most unique ideas and turns of events that clearly show why “Kafkaesque” became to mean what it means."
The Castle,5,"December 20, 2022","how can a literary work be so mundane yet so exceptionally unreal simultaneously? it feels like I've read an excerpt from an individual's insanely boring and monotonous life, yet I can't comprehend how the events from this book have any likelihood to happen in a single miserable lifetime. that is kafka's genius, aka kafkaesque."
The Castle,4,"March 4, 2024","La obra sirve como representación clara de la depresión, de la confusión y del absurdismo intrínsecos a la burocracia, a la infinitud de trámites necesarios para acercarte a una sociedad... empeñada en resistirse a tu participación activa como ciudadano. Kafkaesque, Kafkaesque...."
The Castle,3,"December 21, 2018","honestly the most ""kafkaesque"" kafka in some of the best and all of the worst ways haha"
The Castle,4,"January 11, 2021",Kafkaesque indeed!
The Castle,4,"January 23, 2022","Weird. Wild. The paragraph-long sentences require your undivided attention if you want to avoid have to rewind and reread, but they work somehow, atmospheric. Certainly got a feel for the term “Kafkaesque”."
The Castle,3,"January 18, 2023","i know that’s the whole point of it (and the kafkaesque experience), but my frustration level just hit it’s peak.. 3,5*"
The Castle,4,"January 11, 2024","So strange, like a dream where you're trying to run but your feet won't move. No matter what K does he cannot get to the man in the castle. I understand Kafkaesque much better now."
The Castle,5,"June 13, 2024",No wonder it's called kafkaesque
The Castle,5,"December 29, 2020","I know how true this is because my mom works as an administrative assistant in a insurance and finance company and I see how entirely ridiculous the bureaucracy of modern financial corporations are. They are truly Kafkaesque monstrosities. Kafka knew this so well because he himself worked as a clerk for an Italian life insurance company as well as an unpaid law clerk for various civil and criminal courts in order to acquire his law degree (the labyrinthine nature of legal codes and the judicial bureaucracy being another persistent theme throughout this book). Kafka was also later employed as an insurance investigator for industrial workers’ compensation claims. The themes of hierarchy, poverty, alienation, dehumanization, bureaucracy so perfectly distil the ‘the greatest kept state secret… the misery of everyday life’ as Raoul Vaneigem put it. More than anything in my own experience, it was the misery of everyday work, encounters with careerism and hierarchy, and the drudgery of bureaucratic professional life that radicalized me. It was far less books and propaganda, and far more this everyday experience that generated a total disdain for really existing capitalism. One does not need to point to Soviet experiments that tried to appropriate ‘scientific management’ practices from arch-capitalists like Ford to leapfrog up the ladder of developing one’s productive forces. That bureaucracy and drudgery exist here under capitalism, originated here under its imperial and feudal precursors."
The Castle,3,"May 10, 2025","Aleksandra - who goes by Ola - calls my apartment Kafkaesque. After what could hardly be called a short while, I find myself reading Kafka."
The Castle,5,"December 26, 2024","The society portrayed by Kafka is also deeply stratified and hierarchical, but the paradox becomes evident when we realize the uncertainty that lingers in the reader’s perception of the social pyramid: after all, these power relations are present but always with great volatility and uncertainty. The absence of clear leadership further reinforces this atmosphere of indefinition and helplessness, sentiments that permeate the book. This duality between centralization and decentralization, ostensive power, and invisible authority grants Kafka's narrative an undeniably Kafkaesque quality, a world where authority holds the gift of ubiquity."
The Castle,4,"August 29, 2013","This is my second Kafka - the first being the infamous Trial. The Trial was a special book that confronted me with the absurd nature of both the plot and the philosophy; it was good. I had trouble identifying and experiencing the Kafkaesque quality so many veteran readers have wet their pants indulging in; maybe because there really isn't a definite relatable quality out there. Practical dictionaries like to define it as a ""oppressive nightmarish quality found in Franz Kafka's fictional world that is somehow reminiscent of the reality"". Don't get me wrong, dictionaries are useful, but let's not use it as a guiding pole and force it onto every page of Kafka's works. You find something different if you approach his work naked."
The Castle,4,"January 20, 2025","Quintessentially Kafkaesque, of course. Regarding the recent insurance scandal..."
The Castle,3,"April 25, 2025","To conceive of God—who is not only transcendent and sovereign but also immanent, personal, and knowable—as a cold, unresponsive, and inaccessible force behind layers of red tape and institutional ambiguity is not just theologically incorrect; it is a TRAGIC distortion of the Gospel itself. The God of Scripture is not a Kafkaesque authority figure hiding behind contradictory messengers, cryptic logic, or arbitrary hurdles, but rather the One who, out of an incomprehensible love, chose to make Himself known to a rebellious creation through covenant, incarnation, and ultimately atonement. In Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, we are not only given access to God—we are invited into His very household, adopted as sons and daughters, co-heirs with Christ. The veil is torn, the way is opened, and while the gate is narrow, it is by no means unclear."
The Castle,4,"February 21, 2014","This is the meaning of Kafkaesque. Nightmarish, bureaucratic monotony."
The Castle,3,"November 6, 2019","As the book was never finished, and indeed never meant to be published according to the author himself, one is hard-fought to criticize it as a finished product. Still, for those considering to give the legendary Kafka a try, I suggest reading The Trial and Metamorphosis before giving The Castle a chance, in that order. The Castle is an enjoyable read, and as Kafkaesque as it gets, until about halfway, and so should be reserved for the arduous student of literature or the devoted Kafka-consumer whose thirst cannot be quenched by the two other works mentioned."
The Castle,4,"April 9, 2014","1)Kafka's really about mood, isn't he? The most ""kafkaesque"" feelings can be created even by his short stories (some only a few paragraphs long). Reading a whole novel full of such feelings - dread, frustration, alienation - can be wearysome, especially as many of the characters have a yen for logorrheic soliloquies (and I get that this is parody, but still, it's tough)."
The Castle,2,"February 9, 2017","It was an OK book, not taking into account that The Castle took my great six months to complete it. Generally, I am left with the taste of boredom, overdone long soliloquies and eerie setting. Many claim that Castle symbolises more religious context, to be exact, the God himself. However, I have seen there nothing but another kafkaesque understanding of the world and its system. The Castle relates to the hypocrisy of the governmental bodies, who constantly ignore the needs of its citizens and put their own benefit above others' necessities. K., the protagonist, claims to have moral standards and beliefs to which his own conduct does not conform the accepted behaviour rules of Castle. He apparently underlines the main context of Kafka's pen — not being like all. It was both lamentable and frightening to see K.'s useless efforts to gain his place in society — an individual, who tries to stand out and fight for his ideals, will always be repressed...."
The Castle,Not rated,"June 13, 2011","It’s always the same for me with Kafka. (And by “always” I mean “three times”.) It’s interesting and captivating in this spooky way as the tension increases, but I’m always (each of the three times) in a rush to put an end to it. To finish it and get rid of it, unable to stay in the moment and enjoy the prose, might be for the reason that I find it hard to appreciate the language as particularly beautiful or complex or what have you, but nevertheless strikingly vivid and picturesque. (Hopefully the hardcore fans would excuse the blasphemy here! Words of a layman.) Once I’m through though, it sticks, it stays with me and I often find myself in circumstances which can be most amply described as kafkaesque. Dear friends and acquaintances, I don’t refer to Kafka to sound pretentious, I do it because the situation simply begs for it."
The Castle,3,"December 17, 2015","Climbing ""The Castle"",on the snow covered hill, is not an easy sport for the inexperienced reader, since anyone can only get a ready and packed reality full of symbols and unusual and elusive Kafkaesque characters, not knowing where it is going."
The Castle,2,"September 9, 2024","Menurut saya satu hal yang barangkali alpa dalam menganalisis The Castle, Kafka yakini membahas 'otherness'nya. hampir semua dari catatan dan video review, orang terfokus pada tema-tema Kafkaesque untuk menggambarkan betapa absurnya birokrasi dialami oleh K. bahkan untuk tugasnya saja sebagai tukang pengukur tanah, kang survey K. harus menghadapi beberapa lapis birokrasi: wali kota, guru, pejabat (klam), asisten, perantara. Tapi mereka lupa bahwa betapa K. sebagai seorang outsider di desa (yang tidak diberikan secara spesifik) mendapatkan privalege di suatu penginapan bahkan dengan leluasa memecat dua asisten, sampai dengan tega, ""kedua asisten itu masih menunggu di pagar; dari waktu ke waktu walaupun mereka jelas tampak lelah."" untuk menjelaskan betapa si outsider ini yang dikatakan tidak mendapatkan respek oleh warga desa nyatanya menunjukkan watak yang arogan juga hanya karena dua assisten tidak memenuhi standar K. sebagai surveyor yang tergesa-gesa."
The Castle,3,"July 24, 2016","If someone unfamiliar with Kafka were to read this book, they would find it exactly how people describe a Kafkaesque book, the strange slight surrealistic setting, the general air of doom and despair. The protagonist is a Kafka protagonist cutout, a naive man swept up in events way beyond his control or comprehension. We don't know anything about K., the protagonist, except that he wants to get to The Castle, an authoritative body whose motions are unknown to the general population, that governs the doings of a cluster of villages. His motives and past are unknown, he is sometimes unlikable, other times pitiful. This book is a Kafka retread, incidentally written by Kafka. And if you like Kafka its great. You might as well read a Kafka retread written by Kafka rather than some poor schmuck trying to be pretentious. If you are unfamiliar with Kafka, read his other books first and then come to this one if you like those."
The Castle,3,"August 3, 2016","I tried to read this novel in order to get a better sense of what people mean by ""Kafkaesque"" when they describe China or bureaucracy or pointless disasters of a relentlessly quotidian nature, or Chinese bureaucracy or pointless Chinese disasters of a relentlessly quotidian nature, or pointless bureaucratic disasters of a relentlessly quotidian nature."
The Castle,3,"January 2, 2016","Taking a critical approach to ""The Castle"" is kind of a stupid idea. Aside from the general uniqueness of Kafka's works, ""The Castle"" presents additional challenges by being a work written originally in German and further by being left unfinished and therefore not properly edited or formed into the ideal form at the time of Kafka's death. That being said, there is a certain awkwardness to this novel and towards the latter half there are many long passages and chapters that tend to ramble on into dull and unmoving exposition. However, when the writing performs at its best (towards the beginning of the novel) Kafka presents interesting characters and images that can only be described as ""Kafkaesque."" The strange comedy of robotic villagers, twin assistants reminiscent of Thing 1 and Thing 2, sleeping pince-nez wearing aristocrats viewed through taproom peepholes and endless situations in which simple tasks are made complicated by confusing bureaucracies prove to be hilarious and strange. Kafka is a master of turning simple tasks into painful confusion and isolation for his characters. This book is really just for people who are big fans of Kafka and want to get a further glimpse into his specific form of comedy."
The Castle,4,"December 22, 2015","After I finished this book and read some backstories about it did I know some of the characters are biblical references. But otherwise I took it as what it is, a mythical bureaucratic setting plaguing a village where everyone praises the system and it's tinkerers - not knowing anything about how the system works. What bothered me and the main character K here was that no one knows how the system works and no one is even curious for the knowledge. They spread rumors and weave elaborate imaginary theories about how the system might work and are happy with the knowledge of it. Then I thought back to how systems run in my country/world and realized its the same here. Those people who can think outside the box, figure out that something is wrong with the system are the real dangers of the system as they can destabilize this stupid society. Had a great time reading through it, though it was a bit turmoil reading most of the elaborate conversations in passive voice - I don't know if the original goes like this too. But overall a very Kafkaesque experience."
The Castle,3,"January 1, 2015",It begins to makes sense once you suspend the dystopia filter growing up with Orwellian and Kafkaesque dystopia's portrayed on film.
The Castle,3,"December 9, 2012","So now I see the meaning of the word ""kafkaesque"". This was the first Kafka work I read...there are some good points about this story, but it is quite tedious, especially at the end."
The Castle,5,"April 20, 2015","This book is very, erm, kafkaesque... K. arrives in a village which is governed by the bureaucracy in the eponymous castle. He spends the (inconclusive, as unfinished) novel trying to speak to a higher official about his situation, constantly getting sidetracked by minor squabbles, bureaucratic impediments and his own faults and desires. An allegory on the randomness, futility and frustration of life?"
The Castle,4,"November 1, 2012","At first feels like a retread on The Trial but only so as they are both about very much the same thing - like all his writings, each one is yet another attempt at describing that which is at the very core of the man, something one can not explain but only intuit, that which we call the 'Kafkaesque', what Franz called 'me'."
The Castle,2,"July 31, 2015","painful, frustrating, basically Kafkaesque. This book was on my bucket list so I can mark this one off the list but can't say I enjoyed it. Seriously, life is tough enough and then to read a novel that captures the frustrations of the human condition so well is in one sense remarkable but ultimately futile."
The Castle,4,"June 10, 2010","Can't believe I never read it before. Now I truly know the meaning of Kafkaesque. Ugh, the frustration and the sense of impending doom that this book creates was amazing. I wanted to drink heavily by the time I was halfway through it"

The Castle,5,"October 8, 2012","My favourite Kafka work - what I think of when I hear the 60s/70s cliché, ""Kafkaesque"". One man's horror show, trying to get through an impenetrable bureaucracy, and he foresaw telephone navigation."
The Castle,5,"June 25, 2013",You can't be more Kafkaesque than this book. Unbelievably precise. One of favorite book.
The Castle,5,"October 2, 2014",One word: Kafkaesque
The Castle,4,"July 9, 2023",pretty good but I don’t know if he had to keep describing everything as “kafkaesque”
The Castle,4,"April 23, 2023","when i started this, i thought the book was about how in life we want to badly to get something (getting to the castle), but never really get it and about how what really matters is the journey. but it's not at all about that. that would be too optimistic for a kafka book. i wouldn't be able to tell you what it actually is about, because who the fuck knows what was going through that man's brain when he wrote this? but K starts out simply as a land surveyor that was hired for a job by the castle, and i thought when he finished the job he would simply go away again. but there was a mistake and he wasn't supposed to have been hired, and instead of simply going away again, he is willing to do anything to stay. and we don't know anything about his previous life, which adds to the surrealness of the novel. the castle is always right there, but it's simply inaccessible. and he idolizes the people who have access to it, and, as i said, wants to talk to klamm at all costs. i guess it's a book about this idolization of people in power, like they are untouchable, and how inefficient bureaucratic processes usually are. he was going through all efforts just to achieve nothing. it's the most kafkaesque thing you could have."
The Castle,4,"April 28, 2024","Nhưng cũng như Kafka nói, con người phải đọc những cuốn sách mà thật tâm đau khổ đến quằn quại tâm hồn và chà đạp vào con tim nhỏ bé của họ đến mức chẳng chịu đựng được nổi thì thế mới gọi là đọc, chứ đọc những cuốn sách chữa lành thì thật sự không có sách mới là thứ khiến con người chữa lành. Tuy nói vậy nhưng qua cuốn sách này của ông mình cũng không đọng lại được gì nhiều =)) Mình biết sách Kafka đọc không dễ, và đối với một chiếc lá non đến nỗi trâu bò còn chê như mình mà chỉ đọc có 2 cuốn của ông thì làm sao hiểu được ""kafkaesque"" như thế nào."
The Castle,3,"July 25, 2020","Kafka’s world, both his own and his novels’, isn’t a pleasant one, to say the least. Unimaginably cruel, miserably prudent, and horrifyingly haunting, his writings brings out what others might scare away from. Yet what he writes is a sad and miserable part of us all. ‘Kafkaesque’, the term assigned to Kafka, defines a nightmarish world where we all find ourselves in a dark place, powerless, and unable to fight back. Harshly nourished by his father, the timid Kafka never developed the courage to fight against the injustices of the world, even the one most immediate to him: his family. But through his writings, he greatly achieved to explore with courage, and explain with eloquence, the feelings of powerlessness, pain, and acceptance as the only way to live in a cruel world. All of his works, short stories and unfinished novels, tells one horrific tale or another where the protagonist is unfairly prudent and unfairly obedient; where the guilt is already filled inside him, for which he feels deserved to be punished. His unfinished novels show his own displeasement about his writing that he never completed them and left a note that they should be destroyed after his death. The Castle, one of his three novels, is based upon a character K. who comes to a dark village, as a supposed land surveyor. From the moment he enters the village, he comes to know about The Castle that holds absolute authority over the village. He hardly finds a place to sleep the first night, since he doesn’t have a permit, and by the next days, his title of land surveyor becomes as ambiguous as his own position in the village. He is assigned two assistants, nevertheless, which proves to more nuisance than useful. One day, he receives a letter from Klamm, an official from The Castle, through Barnabas, his assistant. But his recognition in the village, along with his work remain ever so confusing. Finally, it’s found that there’s been a misunderstanding about K. being a land surveyor, and is assigned a janitor in school. Meanwhile, one night during a pub, K. seduces Freida, Klamm’s wife, who at that very night leaves Klamm and runs away with K. But for K., Freida only remains a way to reach to Klamm – which is K.’s whole motive throughout the novel. His desperate attempts, sometimes through Barnabas, sometimes through Freida, to reach Klamm, however, remains impossible, in what seems to be the consequence of the power-divide and K.’s uncertain identity. However, Freida eventually leaves the preoccupied and boring K. for his assistant Jeremiah, and Pepi, another woman from the village takes her place at the inn at the same time. From this point on, the novel stretches into long meandering conversations, which paragraphs that goes continues for pages. Compared to the first half of the novel, the second part loses its engaging element and becomes a source of skim-reading. Though not as bleak as some of Kafka’s other novels, The Castle, nevertheless, ..."
The Castle,4,"April 27, 2025","This is Franz Kafka's last novel, an unfinished novel before his death, that is different from the other ""Kafkaesque"" style that any reader of Kafka will be familiar with."
The Castle,4,"July 10, 2025","The Kafkaesque feeling was somewhat amplified, but not for a better effect, by the use of some modern sound effects."
The Castle,5,"December 16, 2024","Franz Kafka’s The Castle stands, in my view, as his most amazing, enigmatic, and meticulously constructed work, even in its unfinished state. It is a novel that encapsulates Kafka’s unmatched ability to blend the surreal with the painfully real, creating a world that is at once alien and profoundly familiar. The term “Kafkaesque” or “kafkian” finds its fullest expression here, as readers experience the suffocating absurdity of K.’s plight within a bureaucratic maze that feels eerily similar to modern struggles with institutional opacity and systemic indifference."
The Castle,5,"January 29, 2018","Alongside his final story collection, The Castle is probably Kafka's most well written piece of literature. Though I wouldn't consider plot to be Kafka's strongest point, The Castle's overall story is by far his most coherent and captivating. The prose is as elegant as it is dense, and I actually enjoyed reading about the unknown bureaucracy of The Castle moreso than in The Trial. The surreal, and at times nonsensical workings of The Castle are implemented in expected Kafkaesque fashion, yet is so well integrated into the conduct of the village that its no longer a spectacle. Rather, the system's workings no longer distracts from the conventions of the novel as it does in The Trial (which I understand is part of the court's mystery/influence), but instead features as such an interesting extension of the village's ways (Amalia's punishment) that the atmosphere it creates surpasses all other Kafka works. I can't help but picture a small, European village, captured in a snow-globe and consistently shaken by an indescribable force wearing an expensive watch. K., by all means an underdog in this incarnation (rather than the dick he is in The Trial), is left to navigate this artificial snowstorm both literally and metaphorically. He can not, and no longer wishes to escape, but instead aims to set out on the job that was intended for him at whatever cost. He is tossed to and fro, unable to truly identify the correct way to obtaining access to The Castle. Yet, when all seems to be finally clearing, and K. finds perhaps the only man that can aid him, he is left buried by the path he has attempted to clear for himself, fatigued and overwhelmed."
The Castle,3,"September 25, 2020","I have read a lot of works described as ""Kafkaesque,"" but until now, I had never read any Kafka. It is an odd dynamic to have had so many ideas planted in my head about what an author is like before even picking up his work, and I have to say, I think people use the word ""Kafkaesque"" a bit liberally. But I can certainly see his influences on later works, particularly Beckett."
The Castle,5,"July 4, 2023","What Kafka’s ‘The Castle’ is not is a pleasant, leisurely read. Rather, it is certainly an enigmatic novel that immerses readers into the world of bureaucratic absurdity and Kafkaesque existentialism. In it, readers are invited to join the character K.’s journey on a frustrating quest for recognition and belonging, certainly a metaphor for the challenges many face within society today."
The Castle,3,"April 2, 2024","Kafka’s ‘The Castle’ is another example of why the term Kafkaesque was derived from his nightmarish works. The story follows a man known only as K. (the same name as the protagonist of ‘The Trial’ though a different figure, and interestingly the stories very much mimic one another) who has been recruited as a surveyor by the castle, though he finds he was mistakenly appointed and has no work. Alike to ‘The Trial’ K. finds himself in an endless and futile struggle to appeal to “the castle” and have his case looked over, where he finds no belonging in both the village and among the officials of the castle."
The Castle,3,"June 3, 2024","How does one review an unfinished work? It is well-known that The Trial, widely regarded as Kafka’s masterpiece, was also unfinished upon its posthumous publication. The work nonetheless succeeded in relaying its message, namely: the torturous nature of bureaucracy. The Castle, at least ostensibly, shares this theme. The premise is brilliant, fixing the attention of the reader from early on in the first chapter. Indeed, much of the actual story arc is quite gripping, with K.’s ever-futile attempts to obtain even a brief conversation with a lowly office secretary adding to the castle’s sense of obscurantism. But I have to admit that the protracted passages regarding K.’s relationship(s) with Freida, with Barnabas’s family and with the landlady were at times utter patience-testing tedium. I will give our friend Franz the benefit of the doubt and assume that, had he been alive to publish a finished version, he would have greatly redacted the long, drawn-out exchanges between this garrulous village peasant or that. The novel paradoxically suffers from being too short to have fleshed-out the inner workings of the castle and too long to not feel like an insufferable slog. I think the publication of this book (against the author’s wishes, it should be noted) did Kafka a great injustice, although as already mentioned it did work out with the publication of The Trial. I am therefore at a loss to understand the praise heaped on such an unstructured and underdeveloped novel. And of course when discussing Kafka one is always met with arguments of ‘that’s the whole point’ and ‘well it’s supposed to be unenjoyable’ and ‘now you understand bureaucracy’. I sympathise with this position to some degree, but I’m not at all convinced that in order to expose and criticise something frustrating, the way in which you expose and criticise has to be equally frustrating. It is probably the most ‘Kafkaesque’ of Kafka’s novels, but certainly not my favourite. Three stars by dint of it being unfinished and therefore being cut a generous amount of slack."
The Castle,3,"December 16, 2024","this is my first time reading anything of kafka's and i can definitely say now that i understand what ""kafkaesque"" means haha. the oppression of this world was boldly imagined and it was interesting to navigate as a reader. something else about this story i thought notable was that it's logic progressed similarly to how a dream's logic would. the movements made sense but also... didn't? it was a strange simultaneity of validating the reality and not comprehending its seriousness. i actually quite liked that."
The Castle,3,"July 5, 2021","Franz Kafka is known for his dark, uniquely disorienting and surreal writing style often termed as ""Kafkaesque"" as a representation of his fictional world. His writing style had a lot to do with his father who had a profound impact on his life and writings. Kafka's father had hoped that his son would measure upto his 'ideal' stature of a person and had tried to mould him in accordance with those expectations, but Kafka couldn't fit into his father's idea of him. He was born a small, anxious and sickly boy because of which he became a disappointment for his father and often a psychological punching bag. Kafka started writing in his adolescence as a way of dealing with this self loathing and anxiety but did not complete or publish his work as he thought it to be unworthy. He died believing his work wasn't any good. Only after his death, his work got published and he became one of the biggest literary and philosophical name of the Twentieth century."
The Castle,3,"June 13, 2022","Just like all of Kafka's novel, this novel was left unfinished by the time of his death, much to most of the readers' dismay. Kafkaesque aspects are, of course, in this novel but ""The Trial"" was still better than ""The Castle""."
The Castle,3,"December 26, 2023","So… I’m very glad to have read it, but it was heavy-going. It is reliably Kafkaesque (an individual trying in vain to prevail in a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, illogical world) but overwritten. There is real humour in the several long monologues that reinterpret what K. so far thinks to be true, then backtrack and throw doubt on the reinterpretation, and so on. The humour comes partly from their length—in one crucial monologue poor K. actually falls asleep, missing his chance of a breakthrough—but the length often outlasts the humour and had my own eyelids drooping, waiting interminably for the next bit of action. Character and action were often humorous too—had me thinking of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and through the Looking Glass. Poor Kafka—I share his frustration that he wasn’t spared to finish this and polish it to his own satisfaction."
The Castle,4,"July 18, 2024","A very original book, truly deserving for Kafka and his works of the word kafkaesque."
The Castle,2,"June 24, 2024","If you know Kafka through Metamorphosis or The trial then you mignt have to reconsider your expectations on this. Many consider this unfinished book as his best work, and ironically I couldn't finish reading it to the end. As though it was intended by Kafka to leave it midway. The prose seem to be a result of deliberate effort to deliver tedium. I guess Kafka wanted the readers to feel the kafkaesque essence of bureaucracy. How the world of bureaucracy tears the life out of a man and alomg with it any reason to go on living. This is what happened, I, for the very reason, of the vacant atmosphere of dead human hope, weary atmosphere of human nature, couldn't take it. I wanted to put it down afyer page 100 but carried on with all my effort and had to leave it when all I had around 60 pages left. Kafka perhaps succeeded in doing what he might have intended. And I must say, in order for anyone to get acquainted with the actual definition of 'kafkaesque world' this is what they should read. Couldnt rate it more than two star because I hated the way I felt whole through the book, as though I'm wasting my life, every single minute of it while I held on the book. At times a single paragraph went on for more than 4 pages; a single sentence went on for more then a dozen lines. I've read many tedious works but never anything closely like The Castle. It reminds me of a quote I read somewhere I cant remember at the moment, but it was something like this: ""Boredom is the worst tjing a man can undergo."" Kafka has proved it."
The Castle,5,"December 15, 2023","You want to read something weird, unusual and Kafkaesque? Well, you don't need to go far, here it is, your, our, his, her Herr Kafka with his strange lands, which are at the same time very familiar because it is a parallel world which he depicts."
The Castle,2,"April 27, 2024","Despite its incompleteness, which arguably strengthens the themes of alienation and powerlessness, the work could benefit from further editorial refinement. Perhaps a deeper exploration of the nightmarish bureaucracy, or even a more nightmarish portrayal itself, could enhance the Kafkaesque atmosphere."
The Castle,3,"January 31, 2018","K. our pitied, helpless character returns again in this book ‘The Castle ‘ which is set up to start on the most Kafkaesque way possible. The settings of the book are drawn to display a Land Surveyors’s struggle against the higher Castle and multiple levels of pseudo-hierarchies that are present in the village. Unlike most of his other works , I found The Castle to be a little be more Kafkaesque and a bit more on the humanistic side. And that is for all good as the realistic painting of characters with different plights throughout the book told in equally powerful tone has made the book beautiful, in a different manner. It was very hard to follow the translation at multiple instances, which might be improved in the Newer translation ( that I plan to re-read). It was sad to know that Franz Kafka died before completing this work, which was mounting to the beautiful intersection of plots and development of characters."
The Castle,1,"August 25, 2020","Allow me to explain. As I approached the middle of the book, I started to lose motivation. I felt stuck, just like the protagonist K with his journey to The Castle. Every page, every chapter, it repeatedly presents the battle K had had with the villagers, the middlemen, and the superiors, amongst other things. If Kafka's intention was to let his readers feel K's frustration with the delays in administration processes or the rigidity in bureaucratic systems, then he's succeeded tremendously. So much so, you may have to jump to the end of the book to see where Kafka stopped, and whether K finally reached The Castle. I guess this is what ‘Kafkaesque’ really means."
The Castle,4,"February 21, 2018",The Castle is Vintage Kafka. It is the ultimate 'kafkaesque' novel.
The Castle,5,"October 5, 2021","If you have ever felt frustrated at the DMV or in some inescapable and equally Hellish bureaucratic scenario, this book will speak to you profoundly. It will not soothe your frustration or cure your confusion, but it will act as a kindred spirit with you. It is my favorite Kafka story and the most ""Kafkaesque"" one that I have read. The confusion of reading Kafka is tempered by how hilarious it is once you let your guard down to the impenetrable plot. This book taught me to stop trying to figure out ""the message"" and to enjoy the act of reading for its own sake. Obviously, a deemphasized plot is not for every reader, but it is interesting to see how much more a novel can be, if you're willing to let it be. Fittingly (and tragically) the novel is unfinished and ends mid sentence, like a conversation in line at the DMV with a stranger whose number has been called."
The Castle,4,"October 6, 2021","This book is my first experience with Kafka, and it is not one I will forget. There is plenty to be analysed from this book, themes of religion and a 'kafkaesque' government."
The Castle,2,"November 23, 2021","I've heard of the term 'Kafkaesque nightmare' and assumed it refers to his plots, which it definitely does here, but unfortunately I also think it applies to the reading experience of The Castle."
The Castle,5,"August 12, 2024","You really should have finished this one. Out of all your works, The Castle perfectly captures what we now define as ""Kafkaesque."" It portrays a lonely individual trying to make progress in a hostile environment, dealing with authorities he can never truly reach. The protagonist is constantly attempting to make contacts that initially offer a glimpse of hope, but ultimately amount to nothing. He interacts with people who seem both friendly and hostile at the same time, yet their true nature remains elusive. Are they offering a helping hand, or are they merely using the main character as a tool to further their own careers in this place that seems to worship the law above all else—even though nobody seems to know what the law actually is?"
The Castle,3,"March 2, 2025","The Castle  gave me a better understanding of what is truly meant by the term 'Kafkaesque', and reading this in cold, misty Prague - which I did for most of the duration - enhanced my experience with this book."
The Castle,4,"February 14, 2020",卡夫卡以其“Kafkaesque”的黑色怪诞出名，我却从没觉得格格不入。相反，我对他的文有种毫不费力的理解，无论是“城堡”，还是以前读的“变形记”。一百个人眼里有一百个哈姆雷特，对他的小说的理解完全可以由读者本身的自受限出发，再无限衍射出去。你感受过的矛盾和困惑越多，你对卡夫卡的理解就越深。
The Castle,5,"October 19, 2020","Not quite as brutally 'Kafkaesque' as The Trial, but I feel the use of recurring characters and the less defined goal for the hero allow for much deeper exploration of the human condition and open up perspectives of characters other than K.; the landlady, Pepi and Amalia are particularly prominent examples of characters who are written with incredible detail despite being mostly incidental to the plot."
The Castle,4,"May 13, 2022","Well, that's certainly something! If I thought Blade Runner was kafkaesque, this was REALLY kafkaesque. I do enjoy his writing, as weird, difficult, and confusing as it can be. There is an element of reading fantasy or something, because he creates these worlds that clearly operate with their own, unpredictable rules. And just like The Trial, it has an unsatisfying, incomplete ending, rendered effectively in my translation (Harman) by the book ending mid-sentence."
The Castle,4,"August 15, 2022","Man kan virkelig kjenne den O-så-store følelsen av kafkaesque gjennom boka, og jeg forstod ikke hvor investert jeg var i den lille verdenen som befant seg i den lille mystiske og underfundige landsbyen før jeg lukket boka etter siste side."
The Castle,5,"December 24, 2024","i think this book is the epitome of “ kafkaesque “ which maybe is a hot take but like the mix of dread , confusion , and absurdity creates such a unique and rlly indescribable atmosphere . i think the ending being unfinished , literally stopping mid sentence , is the best and only way for this book to end . no plot , no progress , nothing gained , no ending . even if it kept going there is no way k would’ve made it to the castle , or it would’ve ended right when he got to the village ,,, but that was the whole point !! sounds a bit deterring but this book is rlly more abt the atmosphere it creates than the contents , and imo is kafka’s way to make ppl think abt the parallels of real life and his life , and is what made the book so genius"
The Castle,5,"February 17, 2025","Surreal, absurd and dreamlike, just like always Kafkaesque makes you dizzy in certain ways. I love how Kafka can describe the most trivial human emotion like hurt or anger or jealousy in a way that you have never realized before. It’s like at times he just tells us truths about human emotions that society never lets us know and you might have not known if not for Kafka. This reminded me a lot of Trial even though it’s been few years now after I read it, but the sequences of walking through dark alleys in Trial I vividly remember which were similar to few situations in The Castle. A good read for anyone who wants to analyze emotions and situations with a completely new POV and hear them described like never before."
The Castle,4,"February 12, 2018","Es ist kafkaesque. Wenn man Erfahrung mit Kafka's Werken hat, dann weißt man von vorneherein auf was man sich einlässt. Es ist deprimierend und niederdrücken aber zugleich auch komisch und absurd. Kafka schaft es trotz der Absurdität oder vielleicht gerade deshalb eine Beziehung zum Alltagsleben, womit man sich selbst identifizieren kann oder Teile davon. Man kann Kafka's Werke hassen oder lieben aber einst muss man ihm lassen, sein Schreibstil hat diese Kraft und die Wirkung einen in diesen Hoffnungslosigkeit Zustand zu versetzen, wo man zugleich darüber froh ist, dass man nicht in den Schuhen des Protagonisten steckt."
The Castle,5,"April 6, 2022","One of my all-time favorite novels, so mysterious and inconclusive yet perennially re-readable. As I write (in https://ishamcook.com/2012/06/16/mult...), ""No other writer more convincingly recreates the sensation of being high on hallucinogens than Kafka, the feeling of being lost in a carnival funhouse, chock full of surprises and obstacles and repeatedly sprung complications, in short, the “Kafkaesque”—without the use of drugs. It is also a metaphor for the experience of modern bureaucracy, which does trap us in eerily similar situations of frustration, helplessness or panic."""
The Castle,2,"April 23, 2022","Firstly the punctuation is almost unreadable, with many chapters being a single paragraph. This is no doubt an attempt to remain faithful to the original manuscripts, but it makes the reading experience far too Kafkaesque (I read the original JA Underwood translation and I would suggest finding a different translation that adds in paragraphs)."
The Castle,4,"January 29, 2020","I definitely enjoyed reading this, but I had to use a very different form of reading than I usually do. I couldn't really pay attention to the characters and follow the story as much as I could just read it and let it flow. I don't think any of Kafka's other works embody the ""kafkaesque"" feeling as well as this novel does, with its incredibly dense yet sparsely punctuated or structured text, confusing plot, lack of an ending, and focus more on the emotions and feelings of the characters than on any actual traits or events."
The Castle,5,"May 3, 2020","Even better than The Trial, as good as The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, The Castle is Kafka at his most wildly and surreally ""Kafkaesque""."
The Castle,2,"October 1, 2022","Not sure if publishing this book in its unedited format was the right decision as at times the text is so dense and chaotically meaningless that it just sucks all the joy out of you. That is ofcourse, very Kafkaesque, but whether the man himself would have been proud of this achievement is a good question."
The Castle,5,"May 9, 2024","The Castle is my favorite Kafka book - really really great, the book feels so alive, kafkaesque, so real yet so nightmarish. The characters feel alive, as if they are really talking. It is frustrating and also interesting at the same time to kind of live through the protagonist's life, which is full of hardship and the struggle of navigating bureaucracy but also mundane things in this snowy village he finds himself in. In his struggle, the protagonist finds his happiness. Perhaps one of the best existentialist novels"
The Castle,4,"August 17, 2022",Probably a bit pointless writing a review of an old classic. Not exactly a page turner (took me a long time to slog through). However he has a genius for creating a unique off kilter world saturated with confusion and futility. Like Orwell and the “Orwellian” once you have read Kafka you can’t help but see the kafkaesque in many places. No one captures the tangled web of impersonal bureaucracy like he does.
The Castle,4,"July 17, 2023","I must not lie, I did not grasp The Castle as well as The Trial or The Metamorphosis. However Kafka had me throwing his book at the end in the usual Kafkaesque fashion as I flipped the page eager to find out what happens next, there is nothing for me to read. I felt as I finished reading the book as if nothing had happened from chapter 1, so much happened, unlike The Trial it wasn't a slow pace story, It was an eventful drama."
The Castle,5,"September 27, 2023","I’d come to understand what was meant by ‘Kafkaesque’ perhaps even before I first read any of his short stories. The short stories that I did read certainly had hints of what I understood the phrase to mean, but never quite felt like the source of the meaning I held to be encapsulated by the word. This novel more than anything else that I’ve read to this point aligns with the definition I’ve come to understand of ‘Kafkaesque’ and I loved it."
The Castle,4,"February 21, 2024","I read this book years ago and this is just a reread. Kafka's book of course is not really about the narrative- which never resolves- but about the frustrations and dead-end alleys of administrative entities. The picture Kafka paints is masterful and unforgettable: hence the common usage of the word: Kafkaesque, a word I used last week in speaking with the authorities at the Canada Revenue Agency."
The Castle,5,"December 16, 2024","I was fully immersed into this kafkaesque world, where days felt like years and years where mere seconds. I'm in awe of how delicately the bureaucracy of The Castle is comparable to real-life and how just in four days we get to know everything about this weird village."
The Castle,3,"January 19, 2025","Kafka's world is tough to grasp for the protagonist, tougher for me. I found the read very alienating, which I think is purposeful. I quite liked the sketch of the characters and environment along with the initial parts of the book. However, the book being incomplete and tough to follow is why I would claim this novel to be my least favorite of his works. Yet, its beautiful and unique in its own kafkaesque way."
The Castle,5,"October 21, 2017","I love Kafka at his most Kafkaesque. The breathless, endless sentences and paragraphs are not only intricate but fascinating. The whole story is shrouded in fog, amplifying the intermittent moments of clarity. The characters, as alien as they seem, have an undeniable humanity. The not-knowing is, for once, all we need to know."
The Castle,1,"June 17, 2020","Were my hopes too high? Was I spoiled by reading Aziz Nesin, who perhaps does a better job at writing Kafkaesque stories? Who knows? Maybe I just don’t get it?"
The Castle,3,"December 15, 2022",I preferred The Trial over this one. Very interesting to start but it feels like the Kafkaesque dulls out halfway through the book. Will also say the translation felt clumsy.
The Castle,2,"August 19, 2023",Kawki to ja potrzebowałem żeby nie usnąć podczas każdej próby lektury męczyłem się z tym 3 tygodnie. Tęsknie za moją polonistka ona by mi wytłumaczyła geniusz tego dzieła. kAfKaEsQuE af ale co z tego jak poza tym nie ma nic. Franz look at me baby this isnt you. Zamek wydano pośmiertnie wbrew woli Kafki i może tym razem warto by wole zmarłego uszanować :*
The Castle,4,"April 22, 2024","The most Kafkaesque of all Kafka novels? You are totally emerged in the nonsensical labyrinth of the castle's politics in a way that can be nearly as frustrating to read as it is to experience this type of beauracracy. Not exactly a fun read for this reason, but great for all of the reasons you would expect."
The Castle,5,"January 9, 2025","absolutely incredible, deep and uncanny study of a world of inaccessibility described through the journey of anxiety and unknown foreigness all in kafkaesque style which is challenging yet beautiful because of winding and complex sentences. Longer than ""The Trial"" and maybe a bit more boring at times but still one of my personal favourites as a whole"
The Castle,5,"June 29, 2025","What a horrible world this place is! I think the plot is less important than being immersed in a world that is truly ""Kafkaesque"". It's not an easy read -- paragraphs go on for pages; sentences go on for line after line. But in the end you're just left with an impression of a place that's awful and you'd never want to visit. For that reason I liked it alot, and am going to go to ""The Trial""."
The Castle,4,"July 7, 2025","The story seems to meander haplessly- although I suspect it’s because I listened to it via audiobook in the car, and likely missed many nuances. After also reading Metamorphosis, I’m beginning to understand the term Kafkaesque. He has a very unique way of writing and storytelling. He writes the kind of books you could base an entire class off of."
The Castle,3,"August 14, 2017","If you've read The Trial you've effectively read The Castle. Indeed there are passages in the two books that are almost identical. I fully understand the meaning of Kafkaesque but do not rate him as a great writer, more an angst ridden individual in an alien world."
The Castle,2,"December 7, 2024",Safe to say I know the meaning of Kafkaesque… Let me just say I respect Kafka and I loved the Metamorphosis but the EXPERIENCE of reading this book was a two star one. BUT the real-world experience of navigating red tape is also 1-2 stars and that’s the whole point so…that’s what I’ve got to say.
The Castle,4,"March 27, 2018",Haiku review (for Everyman’s Library edition): No paragraphs for / dialogue made reading this / quite Kafkaesque.
The Castle,4,"January 28, 2021","just peak Kafkaesque. I enjoyed the read, although I prefer the Trial because of its vivid suffocative value. Still, perfect."
The Castle,3,"May 28, 2021",Now I know what it means when they say its Kafkaesque!
The Castle,4,"July 5, 2021",Your typical kafkaesque style which I love (although I'm not sure why).
The Castle,Not rated,"February 21, 2022",Reading this was...Kafkaesque.
The Castle,4,"May 10, 2022",Too Kafkaesque and the ending was a cliffhanger 乁( •_• )ㄏ
The Castle,Not rated,"May 18, 2023",Very… kafkaesque
The Castle,4,"June 26, 2023","His journey turned out to be pointless. At some point he forgot his main goal and wandered endlessly in his own created labyrinth. He met many villagers along in his journey, did he only used them for his goals? We didn't really know, it's all ambiguous. A must read novel, although at first I'm not used with the novel structure eventually it becomes enjoyable ride. Now, I understand completely what's all the fuss about “Kafkaesque”."
The Castle,3,"November 23, 2023",Höjden av kafkaesque litteratur. Lik Processen men längre och tråkigare.
The Castle,Not rated,"March 27, 2024","Idk how to review this but this is the most kafkaesque thing you’ll ever read. Make sure to read up on his lore before reading the castle, helped make everything make sense"
The Castle,4,"January 25, 2025","Exemplarily Kafkaesque, yet profoundly relatable to so many aspects of modern society, politics, theology, etc."
The Castle,4,"February 28, 2025",awfully Kafkaesque
The Castle,4,"April 10, 2025",Yes yes very kafkaesque
The Castle,4,"May 27, 2025",Good book lowkey kafkaesque
The Castle,2,"June 1, 2025",Weird and quite a frustrating read. Understand the term Kafkaesque in view of bureaucracy but doesn’t necessarily make reading it that enjoyable
The Castle,3,"November 17, 2023",Reading The Castle trained my brain to make my nightmares worse... I now have Kafkaesque anxiety dreams
The Castle,2,"March 21, 2024",Man tries to gaslight his way into a mysterious bureaucratic regime. Fails. Book ends mid sentence because Kafka dies. 10/10 on the Kafkaesque scale
The Castle,4,"July 6, 2022",An incredibly Kafkaesque adventure
The Castle,5,"February 23, 2025","The story isn't as horrific as 'The Trial', but it has the same Kafkaesque note."
The Castle,2,"May 10, 2025","Described as a powerful allegory, The Castle to me reads more like an overlong inside joke between a nihilist and his therapist. If this is what it means to be Kafkaesque, count me out."
The Castle,4,"September 13, 2021","A dark and dreamy novel by Franz Kafka, with the unparalleled and distinctive Kafkaesque atmosphere."
The Castle,2,"November 7, 2016","Aside from one or two moments (for example, when K fell asleep whilst in the presence of the very man who might have been able to help him) I didn't even find this novel satisfyingly Kafkaesque. The Trial was more in my line in that regard but that book was ultimately a great disappointment to me as well. I'm left to conclude that, Metamorphosis aside, Kafka is grotesquely over-rated and of interest more to scholars and pseuds than to the ordinary, intelligent reader looking for a good story with some intellectual depth to it."
The Castle,5,"February 24, 2022",Kafkaesque.
The Castle,3,"August 13, 2021","I found it abit challenging to get through this book due to the frustrating nature of the character’s journey, the fleeting characters and all the uncertainty the character faces while he navigates through the strange village. Not to mention, the book ends mid-sentence. However, these things are what made the book so intriguing and… ‘kafkaesque’."
The Castle,Not rated,"April 5, 2020","Early on, when I was still enthusiastically reading, I could discern scenes that were written with the dark humor Kafka was famous for. I understood these intellectually, but not emotionally. I had this problem with The Trial, too (when I read that in a time before goodreads). I have trouble understanding the motivations and actions of Kafka's characters and so, cannot fathom the circumstances they then find themselves in. I found the humor in Seinfeld odd, too. The show presented a handful of neurotic characters managing their lives with these emotional handicaps. I don't think this term was ever applied to the popular TV series, but it was Kafkaesque."
The Castle,5,"July 1, 2020","This is a slow nightmare more than a story. A man named K. comes upon a village that is dominated by the castle and its Kafkaesque administration. K is purportedly there to do a task for the castle but as he tries to communicate with its bureaucracy, he can't get clear answers, just strange, long bureaucratic responses. Beyond this there is no story arc. There are just a lot of surreal, absurd and funny episodes as K. lives in the village and deals with the castle administration. If you don't see anything interesting to read here, I don't blame you. But the description of the events of this book doesn't at all do justice to the experience of reading the book. This book (along with all of Kafka's other works) presents a uniquely surreal experience. There is a deep and satisfying surrealism to experience here, not just ""a lot of weird things happen."""
The Castle,4,"February 8, 2025","I have already read The Trial and Amerika, but neither of them was really difficult for me to read, although they too were absurd and “kafkaesque”. The Castle is something else entirely, something quite new. Kafka has once again proved to me his originality and uniqueness, but most importantly the strangeness and greatness of his writing abilities; to create such a complicated story, I wonder what went through his head to be able to come up with such absurdities and to be able to transfigure them with such normality, as if this is all normal to him."
The Castle,4,"February 27, 2025","K, the land surveyor, arrives in the town where he is to be employed by the castle, and questions raised about his eligibility to stay at the inn he's checked into sets the scene for the rest of the book, during which K endures many long and protracted encounters with a series of players, each of whom gives some picture of some of aspect of a bureaucracy which is, of course, only a small part of a much larger bureaucracy between K and the castle from where some guidance on exactly what he has been engaged to do is sought. It's unfortunate that Kafka gave up on the novel without finishing it although it was clear that he was close. Nonetheless, the picture of bureaucracy he portray so vividly is so intense, frustrating, fascination and slightly frightening, it's not surprising that the term Kafkaesque has entered the English language."
The Castle,5,"November 14, 2016","The world Kafka paints is bizarre, run by a strange logic, replete with names of a faceless, unmoving bureaucracy and ruling class that lives in the closest thing to a literal ivory tower. From their privileged Castle, they spin an intricate web of regulations and strange laws that weighs on, burden and thus breaks the back of the naive common man, their machinations spilling over to everyday life Everything that defines the word ""Kafkaesque""."
The Castle,Not rated,"August 17, 2024","This was recommended to me by my professor when I mentioned in class that I was trying to read more Kafka so I could understand what people meant by the term 'Kafkaesque'. At the time, I believe I was reading through The Metamorphosis, or planning to, and Harry told me to read this instead. I bought it right away."
The Castle,3,"January 18, 2022","Turned out to be a difficult read and struggled to finish it. The early part of the book felt meagre until the pace of the narrative picked up in the middle. Came out disappointed, having wanted to be enthralled by Kafka's fictional world. Will probably give metamorphosis a try soon to hopefully make better sense of his writing. I felt as if Hedayat’s Blind Owl lives up to the tag of ‘Kafkaesque’ more so than Kafka after having read The Castle."
The Castle,4,"August 4, 2021","I'll freely admit that Kafka is a tough read. But if you can handle the dense prose, you will be rewarded with an utterly timeless tale of alienation, confusion, and frustration. One you will deeply identify with if you have ever had to deal with the government or a large corporation. There's a reason they call things Kafkaesque!"
The Castle,2,"April 25, 2024","A convoluted read that throws the readers through bureaucratic, meaningless and long-winded plotlines. One of the most Kafkaesque works, you resonate with K. throughout the absurdist story. However, it fails to hold on to one's attention and its length proves boring and not driven."
The Castle,2,"April 13, 2017","Starting to read this book, I finally understood ""Kafkaesque"" writing! It was a struggle to keep reading, but then that's just me!"
Inferno,5,"April 11, 2023","I was completely bowled over by how entertaining this was, how humorous at times, how violent and intelligent and how purely addictive. I’ll admit that like my reading of Joyce, I paced about my bedroom in an imagined auditorium reading the cantos aloud. After each canto I read Sayers’ fantastic notes and pored through online resources to learn more. Writing this review is difficult because I have so much I want to say, I can almost say nothing. It’s impossible to know where to start. So I will hang my rambling from the amazing artwork by Doré; it captures the feeling and atmosphere and pure dramatics of the poem far better than I can. The only thing the artwork doesn't manage to capture is the humour, for there is humour, though it may be hard to believe. Dante writes himself realistically, by which I mean, he hides behind Virgil, he cries a lot (at the beginning of Purgatory he must wash his face of the tears he shed in Hell), and generally finds him startled by everything they come across in Hell, the poor poet even faints on several occasions. There’s no Kafkaesque acceptance of what he sees: Dante is horrified by the horrors of Hell. For example, here is Dante clinging to the arm of Virgil as he pushes Filippo Argenti back into the river Styx in the Fifth Circle."
Samsa in Love,4,"March 5, 2021",Kafkaesque at it's best!!
Samsa in Love,2,"July 19, 2018","Kafkaesque this may be, but Haruki is no Franz."
Samsa in Love,1,"April 17, 2017",This is revese Metamorphosis. A roach turns into Gregor Samsa unlike the Kafkaesque Gregor Samsa turns into roach. And this time the roach tries to figure out the ways to live in a human body. A little more research got me knowing that the setting is Prague City during invasion of Soviet Union. The world outside is unstable and Samsa suddenly finds himself becoming a human.
Samsa in Love,4,"September 19, 2021","Very kafkaesque short story. 👏🏼 It even made me re-read Franz Kafka's original story, for which I changed my opinion and went from ""meh"" to ""wow""."
Samsa in Love,3,"December 21, 2022","A nice and easy read, very Kafkaesque"
Samsa in Love,4,"January 15, 2023",Oh Murakami how very Kafkaesque of you. This is basically The metamorphosis but in reverse🔄🪳
Samsa in Love,3,"November 4, 2016","Samsa in love is exactly that - an attempt by Murakami to address the 'what ifs' in his own bizarre way. ( Almost befitting the original literature.) Considering the fact that Murakami is a fan of Kafka as is evident from his various literary works, trust his writing to sketch the shadows of the original. Mistake me not, Samsa in love  in no way is a great piece of literature - it is as bizarre, as crazy and as mind-boggling as the original. And most definitely serves as a good read for those who dapple in Kafkaesque stories or those who are eager to swallow Murakami's wonder pills."
Samsa in Love,5,"May 1, 2019","This is the first work of Murakami that I've ever read - yes, a little bit shame on me because it is a little bit late- but I can definitely say that I loved it. I loved his style, his language and his way of mixing the Kafkaesque with his style. I think this rewriting of The Metamorphosis should be read by anyone who has loved it."
Samsa in Love,5,"January 23, 2018",kafkaesque.
The Third Policeman,4,"September 23, 2019","The basic plot underlying all of this feckless excogitation is a robbery/murder conspiracy gone wrong--but it really doesn’t matter because the point is the examination of incoherent concepts. Weirdnesses such as “It was a local light that did not extend very much outside its own brightness” (107) and “Omnium is the essential inherent interior essence which is hidden inside the root of the kernel of everything and it is always the same” (110) further indicate that the genre here is not Frye’s confession, but rather his anatomy—menippean satire on an infinite hall of mirrors of philological disputation in the de Selby index; the cast of commentators is diverse and great—and the Kafkaesque police, whose ideas are as inept as de Selby’s, cements it as anatomy."
The Third Policeman,5,"May 4, 2023","Besides some lovely, lyrical descriptions of the landscape and the weather, it's full of absurd, Pythonesque scenes and Kafkaesque conversations. If this puts you off you should read the Author's Note, or find a review that explains the premise."
The Third Policeman,5,"April 16, 2015","Other reviewers have called out Kafka and Joyce, but there are also hints of Poe in the gruesome murder on a foggy night; in passages involving a possibly haunted house that seemingly lures the wary, weary protagonist inside; and echos of The Raven in an creepy conversation with an apparition that always replies ""No!"" to every question. Yet O'Brien quickly departs from Poe's horror to put odd, Kafkaesque words into the apparition's mouth after the narrator outsmarts it and tricks it into saying something other than ""No!""."
The Third Policeman,5,"December 12, 2019","Follow the unnamed narrator, a lazy and amoral young man whose only passion in life is studying the works and biographies of a ludicrous historical crackpot philosopher. The narrator continues to find himself in all sorts of surreal and hilarious Kafkaesque circumstances, which he takes in with a shocking level-headedness, even if he can’t remember most of it in hindsight. He is drawn into a murder plan, arrested by police officers who are obsessed with bicycle thefts, and show to eternity in a room underground, where time and weight and beard length cannot change. Everything that is insane in this book becomes sensible to some degree in retrospect, if one is ready to play philosophy games."
The Third Policeman,5,"April 2, 2021","Flann O'Brien has a preternatural ability to provoke and preserve smiles from his readers for page after page, if not from cover to cover. In The Third Policeman O'Brien does this in his customary dizzying fashion by combining murder, a village police force, a black box, a one-legged army, and lengthy footnotes about an oddball savant and his biographers to tell an absurd, surreal, Kafkaesque story; one that explores existence, death, and eternity in some bewildering triumvirate which frequently leaves the reader uncertain about what is actually going on beyond the one clear notion that somehow bicycles are of the utmost consequence. What's also clear is that O'Brien likes to lighten the load of confusion he puts on his readers by providing endless hilarity and idyllic descriptions of the Irish countryside in a precise and graceful writing style that's uniquely his own."
The Third Policeman,5,"March 29, 2018","Ultimately, Flann O'Brien crafted a fantastically odd novel that seems to have predicted some of the compelling devices used by writers like Nabokov and Borges--despite being published after them-- whilst also employing Kafkaesque plotting to illustrate a darkly funny and bizarre rural Irish landscape."
The Third Policeman,1,"July 11, 2024","Varför den inte hamnade på DNF-listan? Jag fick för mig att det var ""bra"" att läsa något annorlunda. Ordet ""kafkaesque"" (som man ju känner till långt innan/oavsett om man läst Kafka) snurrade i huvudet."
The Third Policeman,5,"December 7, 2019",A thoroughly enjoyable flight of fancy! A fantastical piece of Nonsense to be sure!! Rich in language (as most novels probably are?) Flann O Brien takes us in a Kafkaesque journey of absurdity.. That is of course if one could imagine Franz Kafka being Irish and funny!
The Third Policeman,2,"December 21, 2023","A disorienting depiction of hell with an unlikable cipher of a main character. Not much to like here. Although it is amusing, at times, it can also be frustrating to read dialogue that is essentially comprised of non sequitur after non sequitur. It has overall a very Kafkaesque feel with some Beckett undertones. It is atmospheric and creates a disorienting sense of surrealism, but that doesn't mean it's all that fun to read. When it comes to existentialism, I'll stick to Camus."
The Third Policeman,4,"May 15, 2025","What a wild book... It started out eerie and ominous, like a pastoral Edgar Allan Poe, and then shifts dramatically to a Kafkaesque criminal case, breaking for long, discursive explanations of the inner workings of this bizarre universe, all backed by the philosophy and lore of the mysterious De Selby. I don't think I understood more than half, but it might be brilliant."
The Third Policeman,5,"April 14, 2025","Edit: alright, I did not enjoy it but I’ve come to think that it is good. The central thesis, I think, is that a life of analytic systematizing is itself a kind of kafkaesque hell. Traditionally, I think this lesson would be taught in a way that inadvertently glorifies systematizing, sorta Truffaut’s law for nerds: you can’t make an anti-war movie, or an anti-analytical book."
The Third Policeman,3,"August 12, 2011","A Kafkaesque tale, with a series of post-modern twists and turns that could have come straight out of a Paul Auster novel, but set in rural Ireland, this is a truly original novel. The footnotes on the imaginary scientist/philosopher De Selby are entertaining throughout."
beautiful world where are you,1,"July 12, 2025",If you want to read about two people trying to sound like martyrs of an unbearable existence all the while being so self-centered that their ramblings turn out to be bootleg Kafkaesque musings....this is the book for you.
little bee,3,"January 6, 2013","Little Bee is an affecting novel—though at times it can feel too affecting, to the point of being manipulative. The tone is stark yet somehow faraway, like a nightmarish fairy tale, and the depiction of the Kafkaesque plight of asylum seekers is haunting."
wuthering heights,Not rated,"August 2, 2012","Surely I read a different book than the rest of the world? I can't even bring myself to give this two stars, although I don't hate her writing. I just will never understand how this story is worshiped and romanticized by so many. I understand:evil begets evil. This was just insane, though. This is Kafkaesque before the phrase came into existence. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the family from House of 1000 Corpses were inspired by these people."
The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy,5,"September 29, 2014","Adams has a way of telling stories that jostle the reader. You never know what's coming next. At no point can anyone be complacent and think, ""Oh, crisis averted."" If you do, you'll find that the story will tumble into something unexpected with just a short line. It's all a bit like life. It teaches you that you don't have to read Camus to be an absurdist, really. You just have to read this fat book, laugh your guts out, and before you know it, you suddenly identify with Kafkaesque stuff!"
Geek Love,5,"July 24, 2021","I had the feeling that the story had a Kafkaesque vibe. I’m throwing the word not around like this, but it actually reminded me of Kafka. Oly was similar to Gregor Samsa as far as she is alienated from her family as well; even though she works hard for them, they won’t care for her in the end. Alienation generally is a big topic in Geek Love: how parents become alienated from their children and how siblings become alienated from each other as soon as they grow older."
